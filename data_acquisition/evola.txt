b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfAmerican "Civilisation"\\n\\nThe recently deceased John Dewey was\napplauded by the American press as the most representative figure of American\ncivilisation. This is quite right. His theories are entirely representative of\nthe vision of man and life which is the premise of Americanism and its\n\\\'democracy\\\'.\\n\\nThe essence of such theories is this: that everyone can\nbecome what he wants to, within the limits of the technological means at his\ndisposal. Equally, a person is not what he is from his true nature and there\nis no real difference between people, only differences in qualifications.\nAccording to this theory anyone can be anyone he wants to be if he knows how\nto train himself.\\n\\nThis is obviously the case with the \\\'self-made man\\\'; in\na society which has lost all sense of tradition the notion of personal\naggrandisement will extend into every aspect of human existence, reinforcing\nthe egalitarian doctrine of pure democracy. If the basis of such ideas is\naccepted, then all natural diversity has to be abandoned. Each person can\npresume to possess the potential of everyone else and the terms \\\'superior\\\'\nand \\\'inferior\\\' lose their meaning; every notion of distance and respect\nloses meaning; all life-styles are open to all. To all organic conceptions of\nlife Americans oppose a mechanistic conception. In a society which has\n\\\'started from scratch\\\', everything has the characteristic of being\nfabricated. In American society appearances are masks not faces. At the same\ntime, proponents of the American way of life are hostile to\npersonality.\\n\\nThe Americans\\\' \\\'open-mindedness\\\', which is sometimes cited\nin their favour, is the other side of their interior formlessness. The same\ngoes for their \\\'individualism\\\'. Individualism and personality are not the\nsame: the one belongs to the formless world of quantity, the other to the\nworld of quality and hierarchy. The Americans are the living refutation of the\nCartesian axiom, "I think, therefore I am": Americans do not think, yet they\nare. The American \\\'mind\\\', puerile and primitive, lacks characteristic form\nand is therefore open to every kind of standardisation.\\n\\nIn a superior\ncivilisation, as, for example, that of the Indo-Aryans, the being who is\nwithout a characteristic form or caste (in the original meaning of the word),\nnot even that of servant or shudra, would emerge as a pariah. In this respect\nAmerica is a society of pariahs. There is a role for pariahs. It is to be\nsubjected to beings whose form and internal laws are precisely defined.\nInstead the modern pariahs seek to become dominant themselves and to exercise\ntheir dominion over all the world.\\n\\nThere is a popular notion about the\nUnited States that it is a \\\'young nation\\\' with a \\\'great future before it\\\'.\nApparent American defects are then described as the \\\'faults of youth\\\' or\n\\\'growing pains\\\'. It is not difficult to see that the myth of \\\'progress\\\'\nplays a large part in this judgement. According to the idea that everything\nnew is good, America has a privileged role to play among civilised nations. In\nthe First World War the United States intervened in the role of \\\'the\ncivilised world\\\' par excellence. The \\\'most evolved\\\' nation had not only a\nright but a duty to interfere in the destinies of other peoples.\\n\\nThe\nstructure of history is, however, cyclical not evolutionary. It is far from\nbeing the case that the most recent civilisations are necessarily\n\\\'superior\\\'. They may be, in fact, senile and decadent. There is a necessary\ncorrespondence between the most advanced stages of a historical cycle and the\nmost primitive. America is the final stage of modern Europe. Guenon called the\nUnited States \\\'the far West\\\', in the novel sense that the United States\nrepresents the reductio ad absurdum of the negative and the most senile\naspects of Western civilisation. What in Europe exist in diluted form are\nmagnified and concentrated in the United States whereby they are revealed as\nthe symptoms of disintegration and cultural and human regression. The American\nmentality can only be interpreted as an example of regression, which shows\nitself in the mental atrophy towards all higher interests and incomprehension\nof higher sensibility. The American mind has limited horizons, one conscribed\nto e! veryth ing which is immediate and simplistic, with the inevitable\nconsequence that everything is made banal, basic and levelled down until it is\ndeprived of all spiritual life. Life itself in American terms is entirely\nmechanistic. The sense of \\\'I\\\' in America belongs entirely to the physical\nlevel of existence. The typical American neither has spiritual dilemmas nor\ncomplications: he is a \\\'natural\\\' joiner and conformist.\\n\\nThe primitive\nAmerican mind can only superficially be compared to a young mind. The American\nmind is a feature of the regressive society to which I have already\nreferred.\\n\\nAmerican Morality\\n\\nThe much-vaunted sex appeal of American\nwomen is drawn from films, reviews and pin-ups, and is in large print\nfictitious. A recent medical survey in the United States showed that 75 per\ncent of young American women are without strong sexual feeling and instead of\nsatisfying their libido they seek pleasure narcissistically in exhibitionism,\nvanity and the cult of fitness and health in a sterile sense. American girls\nhave \\\'no hang-ups about sex\\\'; they are \\\'easy going\\\' for the man who sees\nthe whole sexual process as something in isolation thereby making it\nuninteresting and matter-of-fact, which, at such a level, it is meant to be.\nThus, after she has been taken to the cinema or a dance, it is something like\nAmerican good manners for the girl to let herself be kissed - this doesn\\\'t\nmean anything. American women are characteristically frigid and materialistic.\nThe man who \\\'has his way\\\' with an American girl is under a material\nobligation to her. The woman has granted a materia! l favour. In cases of\ndivorce American law overwhelmingly favours the woman. American women will\ndivorce readily enough when they see a better bargain. It is frequently the\ncase in America that a woman will be married to one man but already\n\\\'engaged\\\' to a future husband, the man she plans to marry after a profitable\ndivorce.\\n\\n"Our" American Media\\n\\nAmericanisation in Europe is widespread\nand evident. In Italy it is a phenomenon which is rapidly developing in these\npost-war years and is considered by most people, if not enthusiastically, at\nleast as something natural. Some time ago I wrote that of the two great\ndangers confronting Europe - Americanism and Communism - the first is the more\ninsidious. Communism cannot be a danger other than in the brutal and\ncatastrophic form of a direct seizure of power by communists. On the other\nhand Americanisation gains ground by a process of gradual infiltration,\neffecting modifications of mentalities and customs which seem inoffensive in\nthemselves but which end in a fundamental perversion and degradation against\nwhich it is impossible to fight other than within oneself.\\n\\nIt is precisely\nwith respect to such internal opposition that most Italians seem weak.\nForgetting their own cultural inheritance they readily turn to the United\nStates as something akin to the parent guide of the world. Whoever wants to be\nmodern has to measure himself according to the American standard. It is\npitiable to witness a European country so debase itself. Veneration for\nAmerica has nothing to do with a cultured interest in the way other people\nlive. On the contrary, servility towards the United States leads one to think\nthat there is no other way of life worth considering on the same level as the\nAmerican one.\\n\\nOur radio service is Americanised. Without any criterion of\nsuperior and inferior it just follows the fashionable themes of the moment and\nmarkets what is considered \\\'acceptable\\\' - acceptable, that is, to the most\nAmericanised section of the public, which is to say the most degenerate. The\nrest of us are dragged along in its wake. Even the style of presentation on\nradio has become Americanised. "Who, after listening to an American radio\nprogramme, can suppress a shudder when he considers that the only way of\nescaping communism is by becoming Americanised?" Those are not the words of an\noutsider but of an American sociologist, James Burnham, professor at the\nUniversity of Princeton. Such a judgement from an American should make Italian\nradio programmers blush for shame.\\n\\nThe consequence of the \\\'do your own\nthing\\\' democracy is the intoxication of the greater part of the population\nwhich is not capable of discriminating for itself, which, when not guided by a\npower and an ideal, all too easily loses sense of its own identity.\\n\\nThe\nIndustrial Order in America\\n\\nIn his classic study of capitalism Werner\nSombart summarised the late capitalist phase in the adage Fiat producto,\npareat homo. In its extreme form capitalism is a system in which a man\\\'s\nvalue is estimated solely in terms of the production of merchandise and the\ninvention of the means of production. Socialist doctrines grew out of a\nreaction to the lack of human consideration in this system.\\n\\nA new phase has\nbegun in the United States where there has been an upsurge of interest in so-\ncalled labor relations. In appearance it would seem to signify an improvement:\nin reality this is a deleterious phenomenon. The entrepreneurs and employers\nhave come to realise the importance of the \\\'human factor\\\' in a productive\neconomy, and that it is a mistake to ignore the individual involved in\nindustry: his motives, his feelings, his working day life. Thus, a whole\nschool of study of human relations in industry has grown up, based on\nbehaviourism. Studies like Human Relations in Industry by B. Gardner and G.\nMoore have supplied a minute analysis of the behaviour of employees and their\nmotivations with the precise aim of defining the best means to obviate all\nfactors that can hinder the maximisation of production. Some studies certainly\ndon\\\'t come from the shop floor but from the management, abetted by\nspecialists from various colleges. The sociological investigations go as far!\nas analysing the employee\\\'s social ambience. This kind of study has a\npractical purpose: the ma intenance of the psychological contentment of the\nemployee is as important as the physical. In cases in which a worker is tied\nto a monotonous job which doesn\\\'t demand a great deal of concentration, the\nstudies will draw attention to the \\\'danger\\\' that his mind may tend to wander\nin a way that may eventually reflect badly on his attitude towards the\njob.\\n\\nThe private lives of employees are not forgotten - hence the increase\nin so-called personnel counselling. Specialists are called in to dispel\nanxiety, psychological disturbances and non-adaptation \\\'complexes\\\', even to\nthe point of giving advice in relation to the most personal matters. A frankly\npsycho-analytic technique and one much used is to make the subject \\\'talk\nfreely\\\' and put the results obtainable by this \\\'catharsis\\\' into\nrelief.\\n\\nNone of this is concerned with the spiritual betterment of human\nbeings or any real human problems, such as a European would understand them in\nthis "age of economics". On the other side of the Iron Curtain man is treated\nas a beast of burden and his obedience is maintained by terror and famine. In\nthe United States man is also seen as just a factor of labour and consumption,\nand no aspect of his interior life is neglected and every factor of his\nexistence is drawn to the same end. In the \\\'Land of the Free\\\', through every\nmedium, man is told he has reached a degree of happiness hitherto undreamed\nof. He forgets who he is, where he came from, and basks in the\npresent.\\n\\nAmerican "Democracy" in Industry\\n\\nThere is a significant and\ngrowing discrepancy in the United States between the shibboleths of the\nprevailing political ideology and the effective economic structures of the\nnation. A large part of studies of the subject is played by the \\\'morphology\nof business\\\'. Studies corroborate the impression that American business is a\nlong way from the type of organisation which corresponds to the democratic\nideal of U.S. propaganda. American businesses have a \\\'pyramid\\\' structure.\nThey constitute at the top an articulate hierarchy. The big businesses are run\nin the same way as government ministries and are organised along similar\nlines. They have co-ordinating and controlling bodies which separate the\nbusiness leaders from the mass of employees. Rather than becoming more\nflexible in a social sense the "managerial elite" (Burnham) is becoming more\nautocratic than ever - something not unrelated to American foreign\npolicy.\\n\\nThis is the end of yet another American illusion. America: the\n\\\'land of opportunity\\\', where every possibility is there for the person who\ncan grasp it, a land where anyone can rise from rags to riches. At first there\nwas the \\\'open frontier\\\' for all to ride out across. That closed and the new\n\\\'open frontier\\\' was the sky, the limitless potential of industry and\ncommerce. As Gardner, Moore and many others have shown, this too is no longer\nlimitless, and the opportunities are thinning out. Given the ever increasing\nspecialisation of labour in the productive process and the increasing emphasis\non \\\'qualifications\\\', what used to seem obvious to Americans - that their\nchildren would \\\'go further\\\' than they would - is for many people no longer\nobvious at all. Thus it is that in the so-called political democracy of the\nUnited States, the force and the power in the land, that is to say the\nindustry and the economy, are becoming ever more self-evidently undemocratic.\nThe problem then is! : should reality be made to fit ideology or vice-versa?\nUntil recently the overwhelming demand has been for the former course of\naction; the cry goes out for a return to the \\\'real America\\\' of unfettered\nenterprise and the individual free of central government control.\nNevertheless, there are also those who would prefer to limit democracy in\norder to adapt political theory to commercial reality. If the mask of American\n\\\'democracy\\\' were thereby removed, it would become clear to what extent\n\\\'democracy\\\' in America (and elsewhere) is only the instrument of an\noligarchy which pursues a method of \\\'indirect action\\\', assuring the\npossibility of abuse and deception on a large scale of those many who accept a\nhierarchical system because they think it is justly such. This dilemma of\n\\\'democracy\\\' in the United States may one day give place to some interesting\ndevelopments.\\n\\nComments of New Dawn stuff\\n\\nIn 1945 Julius Evola\\\'s\n"Civilta Americana" was published. Evola\\\'s critique was an attack on the\nAmerican way of life. Aside from a few passages in Rivolta contro il mondo\nmoderno it contained all the important aspects of his analysis of American\nsociety. For some time out of print, "Civilta" Americana was reprinted in the\nearly eighties by the Julius Evola Foundation (Corso Vittorio Emanuele 197 -\nRome) and published with an unsigned preface (included below). It has been\nedited and abridged.\\n\\nWe can only imagine what Evola would write if he were\nalive today to see the putrification of modern American society.\\n\\nThis essay\non America was written at a time when the United States was seen as the\nleading nation of the world and the model of civilisation. After the Second\nWorld War history seemed to have invested the future of humanity in the\ndoctrines and values of Russia and America. On the one side was the Soviet\nUnion, the pure incarnation of the proletarian ideal; on the other side the\nUnited States, offering the most out-and-out bourgeois ideology the world had\nyet seen. These two ideals were shown to the world as two opposed and\nirreconcilable models of existence, of two global alternatives in terms of\nideology, social organisation and culture; but in an article published in 1929\nand in Rivolta contro il mondo moderno (Revolt against the modern world),\nEvola had already put in relief the analogy between the two systems. Over and\nabove the obvious differences of race, of mentality and temperament, and of\nhistorical background, there was a perceptible correspondence betwe! en the\ntwo kinds of system: the meaninglessness of life centred on the economic and\nproductive sphere of existence; the tendency towards the mechanisation and\ndepersonalisation of every human activity; the collectivisation of large\nmasses of individuals enervated by the rhythms of a frenetic, restless\nsociety; the negation of any notion of transcendence (in the one case by means\nof a dull, state-imposed atheism; in the other case through reducing the\nreligious perspective to a banal, moralistic facade); the formless and\nsoulless character of the arts; the utilisation of all intellectual resources\nfor the purpose of encouraging a solely external and quantitative growth.\nBetween two supposedly opposed systems Evola maintained that there existed\nonly one essential distinction to be made: this relates exclusively to the\nnature of political power within the two systems and therefore to their mode\nof procedure in pursuing what is in fact a programme common to both. The\nbureaucratic Sovi! et dictatorship imposes a mortifying and grey view of life\nby means of brash propaganda and the adoption of brutal means of\nadministration which attack every conceivable human right including armed\nrepression of popular dissent. In the \\\'democratic\\\' and capitalist United\nStates the same ends are obtained by a fatalistic notion of the \\\'inevitable\\\'\ndevelopment of society which is realised at the moment that man is severed\nfrom all links with a deeper spiritual reality and becomes absorbed into an\nanaemic unidimensional vision of existence. In that sense the American model\nof existence can be argued to be more insidious than the Marxist one.\\n\\nEvola\ncharges American society with creating a totally vacuous kind of human being,\nwhose terms of reference are exclusively related to personal enrichment,\nwhether financial or \\\'psychological\\\'; one incapable of autonomous choice, an\nabject conformist; someone who has been made crass and incapable by a\nmaterially easy life which is without idealist impulse. Far from being the\nacme of human progress, American society is in fact at the most advanced stage\nof disintegration of modern civilisation. It is so because in America\nregression is taking place at every social level and is neither contained by\nany solid barrier nor challenged by any significant resistance: it is a\nspontaneous and natural development which is now permeating the whole of the\nWestern world.\\n\\nAnyone today who considers American society disinterestedly\nis struck by the impression of a society gone mad, in which the germs of\ndisintegration which Evola pointed to have multiplied and the disease has\nbroken out visibly, defacing a social fabric which was already deteriorating.\nAccording to official statistics more than one fifth of the population of the\nUnited States has been involved with drugs. Organised delinquent hooliganism\nis still on the increase and has come to dominate large areas of some cities;\nevery kind of sexual aberration is being advocated along with an unbridled\nsexual grossness; there is increasing violence and sadism in the cities,\nparticularly among the young; pseudo-religious sects proliferate, dragging\ntheir disciples into a psychological slum world. These phenomena are only the\nmost obviously disquieting symptoms of an accelerating decline towards the\ntotal disintegration of human personality.\\n\\nAccording to traditionalist\ndoctrine as espoused by Evola, American society, in fact, is on an\nirreversible course to extinction.\\n\\nSource:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/6824/evola.htm\'b\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n|\n\\r\\n\n\n# Julius Evola\n\n\\r\\n\n\n## Traditionalist Visionary\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\n\n### Home\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Biography\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Writings\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Traditionalism\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Links\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### About\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\\r\\n\n\nA Sicilian philosopher, occultist, political writer and spiritualist, Julius\nEvola was one of the major advocates of Traditionalism, a philosophy which\nreplaced individual or collective motivation with an appeal toward an eternal\norder which included natural selection.

As we penetrate deeper\ninto this new (and old) interpretation, we encounter various problems,\nforemost among which is the question of the secret of degeneration.\\n\\nIn its\nliteral sense, this question is by no means a novel one. While contemplating\nthe magnificent remains of cultures whose very name has not even come down to\nus, but which seem to have conveyed, even in their physical material, a\ngreatness and power that is more than earthly, scarcely anyone has failed to\nask themselves questions about the death of cultures, and sensed the\ninadequacy of the reasons that are usually given to explain it.\\n\\nWe can\nthank the Comte de Gobineau for the best and best-known summary of this\nproblem, and also for a masterly criticism of the main hypotheses about it.\nHis solution on the basis of racial thought and racial purity also has a lot\nof truth in it, but it needs to be expanded by a few observations concerning a\nhigher order of things. For there have been many cases in which a culture has\ncollapsed even when its race has remained pure, as is especially clear in\ncertain groups that have suffered slow, inexorable extinction despite\nremaining as racially isolated as if they were islands. An example quite close\nat hand is the case of the Swedes and the Dutch. These people are in the same\nracial condition today as they were two centuries ago, but there is little to\nbe found now of the heroic disposition and the racial awareness that they once\npossessed. Other great cultures seem merely to have remained standing in the\ncondition of mummies: they have long been inwardly dead, so that it takes only\nthe slightest push to knock them down. This was the case, for example, with\nancient Peru, that giant solar empire which was annihilated by a few\nadventurers drawn from the worst rabble of Europe.\\n\\nIf we look at the secret\nof degeneration from the exclusively traditional point of view, it becomes\neven harder to solve it completely. It is then a matter of the division of all\ncultures into two main types. On the one hand there are the traditional\ncultures, whose principle is identical and unchangeable, despite all the\ndifferences evident on the surface. The axis of these cultures and the summit\nof their hierarchical order consists of metaphysical, supra-individual powers\nand actions, which serve to inform and justify everything that is merely\nhuman, temporal, subject to becoming and to "history." On the other hand there\nis "modern culture," which is actually the anti-tradition and which exhausts\nitself in a construction of purely human and earthly conditions and in the\ntotal development of these, in pursuit of a life entirely detached from the\n"higher world."\\n\\nFrom the standpoint of the latter, the whole of history is\ndegeneration, because it shows the universal decline of earlier cultures of\nthe traditional type, and the decisive and violent rise of a new universal\ncivilization of the "modern" type.\\n\\nA double question arises from\nthis.\\n\\nFirst, how was it ever possible for this to come to pass? There is a\nlogical error underlying the whole doctrine of evolution: it is impossible\nthat the higher can emerge from the lower, and the greater from the less. But\ndoesn\\\'t a similar difficulty face us in the solution of the doctrine of\ninvolution? How is it ever possible for the higher to fall? If we could make\ndo with simple analogies, it would be easy to deal with this question. A\nhealthy man can become sick; a virtuous one can turn to vice. There is a\nnatural law that everyone takes from granted: that every living being starts\nwith birth, growth, and strength, then come old age, weakening, and\ndisintegration. And so forth. But this is just making statements, not\nexplaining, even if we allow that such analogies actually relate to the\nquestion posed here.\\n\\nSecondly, it is not only a matter of explaining the\npossibility of the degeneration of a particular cultural world, but also the\npossibility that the degeneration of one cultural cycle may pass to other\npeoples and take them down with it. For example, we have not only to explain\nhow the ancient Western reality collapsed, but also have to show the reason\nwhy it was possible for "modern" culture to conquer practically the whole\nworld, and why it possessed the power to divert so many peoples from any other\ntype of culture, and to hold sway even where states of a traditional kind\nseemed to be alive (one need only recall the Aryan East).\\n\\nIn this respect,\nit is not enough to say that we are dealing with a purely material and\neconomic conquest. That view seems very superficial, for two reasons. In the\nfirst place, a land that is conquered on the material level also experiences,\nin the long run, influences of a higher kind corresponding to the cultural\ntype of its conqueror. We can state, in fact, that European conquest almost\neverywhere sows the seeds of "Europeanization," i.e., the "modern"\nrationalist, tradition-hostile, individualistic way of thinking. Secondly, the\ntraditional conception of culture and the state is hierarchical, not\ndualistic. Its bearers could never subscribe, without severe reservations, to\nthe principles of "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\\\'s" and "My\nkingdom is not of this world." For us, "Tradition" is the victorious and\ncreative presence in the world of that which is "not of this world," i.e., of\nthe Spirit, understood as a power that is mightier than any merely human or\nmaterial one.\\n\\nThis is a basic idea of the authentically traditional view of\nlife, which does not permit us to speak with contempt of merely material\nconquests. On the contrary, the material conquest is the sign, if not of a\nspiritual victory, at least of a spiritual weakness or a kind of spiritual\n"retreat" in the cultures that are conquered and lose their independence.\nEverywhere that the Spirit, regarded as the stronger power, was truly present,\nit never lacked for means - visible or otherwise - to enable all the\nopponent\\\'s technical and material superiority to be resisted. But this has\nnot happened. It must be concluded, then, that degeneracy was lurking behind\nthe traditional facade of every people that the "modern" world has been able\nto conquer. The West must then have been the culture in which a crisis that\nwas already universal assumed its acutest form. There the degeneration\namounted, so to speak, to a knockout blow, and as it took effect, it brought\ndown with more or less ease other peoples in whom the involution had certainly\nnot "progressed" as far, but whose tradition had already lost its original\npower, so that these peoples were no longer able to protect themselves from an\noutside assault.\\n\\nWith these considerations, the second aspect of our\nproblem is traced back to the first one. It is mainly a question of\nexplicating the meaning and the possibility of degeneracy, without reference\nto other circumstances.\\n\\nFor this we must be clear about one thing: it is an\nerror to assume that the hierarchy of the traditional world is based on a\ntyranny of the upper classes. That is merely a "modern" conception, completely\nalien to the traditional way of thinking. The traditional doctrine in fact\nconceived of spiritual action as an "action without acting"; it spoke of the\n"unmoved mover"; everywhere it used the symbolism of the "pole," the\nunalterable axis around which every ordered movement takes place (and\nelsewhere we have shown that this is the meaning of the swastika, the "arctic\ncross"); it always stressed the "Olympian," spirituality, and genuine\nauthority, as well as its way of acting directly on its subordinates, not\nthrough violence but through "presence"; finally, it used the simile of the\nmagnet, wherein lies the key to our question, as we shall now see.\\n\\nOnly\ntoday could anyone imagine that the authentic bearers of the Spirit, or of\nTradition, pursue people so as to seize them and put them in their places - in\nshort, that they "manage" people, or have any personal interest in setting up\nand maintaining those hierarchical relationships by virtue of which they can\nappear visibly as the rulers. This would be ridiculous and senseless. It is\nmuch more the recognition on the part of the lower ones that is the true basis\nof any traditional ranking. It is not the higher that needs the lower, but the\nother way round. The essence of hierarchy is that there is something living as\na reality in certain people, which in the rest is only present in the\ncondition of an ideal, a premonition, an unfocused effort. Thus the latter are\nfatefully attracted to the former, and their lower condition is one of\nsubordination less to something foreign, than to their own true "self." Herein\nlies the secret, in the traditional world, of all readiness for sacrifice, all\nheroism, all loyalty; and, on the other side, of a prestige, an authority, and\na calm power which the most heavily-armed tyrant can never count upon.\\n\\nWith\nthese considerations, we have come very close to solving not only the problem\nof degeneration, but also the possibility of a particular fall. Are we perhaps\nnot tired of hearing that the success of every revolution indicates the\nweakness and degeneracy of the previous rulers? An understanding of this kind\nis very one-sided. This would indeed be the case if wild dogs were tied up,\nand suddenly broke loose: that would be proof that the hands holding their\nleashes had become impotent or weak. But things are arranged very differently\nin the framework of spiritual ranking, whose real basis we have explained\nabove. This hierarchy degenerates and is able to be overthrown in one case\nonly: when the individual degenerates, when he uses his fundamental freedom to\ndeny the Spirit, to cut his life loose from any higher reference-point, and to\nexist "only for himself." Then the contacts are fatefully broken, the\nmetaphysical tension, to which the traditional organism owes its unity, gives\nway, every force wavers in its path and finally breaks free. The peaks, of\ncourse, remain pure and inviolable in their heights, but the rest, which\ndepended on them, now becomes an avalanche, a mass that has lost its\nequilibrium and falls, at first imperceptibly but with ever accelerating\nmovement down to the depths and lowest levels of the valley. This is the\nsecret of every degeneration and revolution. The European had first slain the\nhierarchy in himself by extirpating his own inner possibilities, to which\ncorresponded the basis of the order that he would then destroy\nexternally.\\n\\nIf Christian mythology attributes the Fall of Man and the\nRebellion of the Angels to the freedom of the will, then it comes to much the\nsame significance. It concerns the frightening potential that dwells in man of\nusing freedom to destroy spiritually and to banish everything that could\nensure him a supra-natural value. This is a metaphysical decision: the stream\nthat traverses history in the most varied forms of the traditional-hating,\nrevolutionary, individualistic, and humanistic spirit, or in short, the\n"modern" spirit. This decision is the only positive and decisive cause in the\nsecret of degeneration, the destruction of Tradition.\\n\\nIf we understand\nthis, we can perhaps also grasp the sense of those legends that speak of\nmysterious rulers who "always" exist and have never died (shades of the\nEmperor sleeping beneath the Kyffh\\xc3\\xa4user mountain!). Such rulers can be\nrediscovered only when one achieves spiritual completeness and awakens a\nquality in oneself like that of a metal that suddenly feels "the magnet",\nfinds the magnet and irresistibly orients itself and moves towards it.

This misunderstanding is\nalready visible in the use of terms such as "pagan" and "pagandom". I myself,\nhaving used these expressions as slogans in a book that was published in Italy\nin 1928, and in Germany in 1934, have cause for sincere regrets.\\n\\nCertainly\nthe word for pagan or heathen, paganus, appears in some ancient Latin writers\nsuch as Livy without an especially negative tone. But this does not alter the\nfact that with the arrival of the new faith, the word paganus became a\ndecidedly disparaging expression, as used in early Christian apologetics. It\nderives from pagus, meaning a small town or village, so that paganus refers to\nthe peasant way of thinking: an uncultured, primitive, and superstitious way.\nIn order to promote and glorify the new faith, the apologists had the bad\nhabit of elevating themselves through the denigration of other faiths. There\nwas often a conscious and often systematic disparagement and misrepresentation\nof almost all the earlier traditions, doctrines, and religions, which were\ngrouped under the contemptuous blanket-term of paganism or heathendom. To this\nend, the apologists obviously made a premeditated effort to highlight those\naspects of the pre-Christian religions and traditions that lacked any normal\nor primordial character, but were clearly forms that had fallen into decay.\nSuch a polemical procedure lead, in particular, to the characterization of\nwhatever had preceded Christendom, and was hence non-Christian, as necessarily\nanti-Christian.\\n\\nOne should consider, then, that "paganism" is a\nfundamentally tendentious and artificial concept that scarcely corresponds to\nthe historical reality of what the pre-Christian world always was in its\nnormal manifestations, apart from a few decadent elements and aspects that\nderived from the degenerate remains of older cultures.\\n\\nOnce we are clear\nabout this, we come today to a paradoxical realization: that this imaginary\npaganism that never existed, but was invented by Christian apologists, is now\nserving as the starting-point for certain so-called pagan circles, and is thus\nthreatening for the first time in history to become a reality--no more and no\nless than that.\\n\\nWhat are the main traits of today\\\'s pagan outlook, as its\nown apologists believe and declare them to be? The primary one is the\nimprisonment in Nature. All transcendence is totally unknown to the pagan view\nof life: it remains stuck in a mixture of Spirit and Nature, in an ambiguous\nunity of Body and Soul. There is nothing to its religion but a superstitious\ndeification of natural phenomena, or of tribal energies promoted to the status\nof minor gods. Out of this there arises first of all a blood- and soil-bound\nparticularism. Next comes a rejection of the values of personality and\nfreedom, and a condition of innocence that is merely that of the natural man,\nas yet unawakened to any truly supra-natural calling. Beyond this innocence\nthere is only lack of inhibition, "sin," and the pleasure of sinning. In other\ndomains there is nothing but superstition, or a purely profane culture of\nmaterialism and fatalism. It is as though only the arrival of Christianity\n(ignoring certain precursors which are dismissed as insignificant) allowed the\nworld of supra-natural freedom to break through, letting in grace and\npersonality, in contrast to the fatalistic and nature-bound beliefs ascribed\nto "paganism," bringing with it a catholic ideal (in the etymological sense of\nuniversality) and a healthy dualism, which made it possible to subjugate\nNature to a higher law, and for the "Spirit" to triumph over the law of flesh,\nblood, and the false gods.\\n\\nThese are the main traits of the dominant\nunderstanding of paganism, i.e., of everything that does not entail a\nspecifically Christian world-view. Anyone who possesses any direct\nacquaintance with cultural and religious history, however elementary, can see\nhow incorrect and one-sided this attitude is. Besides, in the early Church\nFathers there are often signs of a higher understanding of the symbols,\ndoctrines, and religions of preceding cultures. Here we will give only a\nsampling.\\n\\nWhat most distinguished the pre-Christian world, in all its\nnormal forms, was not the superstitious divinization of nature, but a symbolic\nunderstanding of it, by virtue of which (as I have often emphasized) every\nphenomenon and every event appeared as the sensible revelation of a supra-\nsensible world. The pagan understanding of the world and of man was\nessentially marked by sacred symbolism.\\n\\nMoreover, the pagan way of life was\nabsolutely not that of a mindless innocence, nor a natural abandonment to the\npassions, even if certain forms of it were obviously degenerate. It was\nalready aware of a healthy dualism, which is reflected in its universal\nreligious or metaphysical conceptions. Here we can mention the dualistic\nwarrior-religion of the ancient Iranian Aryans, already discussed and familiar\nto all; the Hellenistic antithesis between the "two natures," between World\nand Underworld, or the Nordic one between the race of the Ases and the\nelementary beings; and lastly the Indo-Aryan contrast between sams\\\'ra, the\n"stream of forms," and m(o)kthi, "liberation" and "perfection."\\n\\nOn this\nbasis, all the great pre-Christian cultures shared the striving for a supra-\nnatural freedom, i.e., for the metaphysical perfection of the personality, and\nthey all acknowledged Mysteries and initiations. I have already pointed out\nthat the Mysteries often signified the reconquest of the primordial state, the\nspirituality of the solar, Hyperborean races, on the foundation of a tradition\nand a knowledge that were concealed through secrecy and exclusivity from the\npollutions of an environment already in decay. We have also seen that in the\nEastern lands, the Aryan quality was already associated with a "second birth"\nachieved through initiation. As for natural innocence as the pagan cult of the\nbody, that is a fairy-tale and not even in evidence among savages, for despite\nthe inner lack of differentiation already mentioned in connection with races\n"close to nature," these people inhibit and constrict their lives though\ncountless taboos in a way that is often stricter than the morality of the so-\ncalled "positive religions." And as for that which seems to the superficial\nview to embody the prototype of such "innocence," namely the classical ideal,\nthat was no cult of the body: it did not belong on that side of the body-\nspirit duality, but on the other side. As alreay stated, the classic ideal is\nthat of a Spirit that is so dominant that under certain favorable spiritual\nconditions it molds Body and Soul to its own image, and thereby achieves a\nperfect harmony between the inner and the outer.\\n\\nLastly, there is an\naspiration away from particularism to be found everywhere in the "pagan"\nworld, to which was due the imperial summons that marked the ascending phase\nof the Nordic-derived races. Such a summons was often metaphysically enhanced\nand refined, and appeared as the natural consequence of the expansion of the\nancient sacred state-concept; also as the form in which the victorious\npresence of the "higher world" and the paternal, Olympian principle sought to\nmanifest itself in the world of becoming. In this respect we might recall the\nold Iranian concept of Empire and of the "King of kings," with its associated\ndoctrine of the hvaren\\xc3\\x99 (the "celestial glory" with which the Aryan\nrulers were endowed), and the Indo-Aryan tradition of the "World-king" or\ncakravart\\xc3\\x93, etc., right up to the reappearance of these signifiers in\nthe "Olympian" assumptions of the ancient Roman idea of State and Empire. The\nRoman Empire, too, had its sacred contents, which were systematically\nmisunderstood or undervalued not only by Christendom, but also by the writers\nof "positive" history. Even the Emperor-cult had the sense of a hierarchical\nunity at the top of a pantheon, which was a series of separate territorial and\nancestral cults belonging to the non-Roman peoples, which were freely\nrespected so long as they kept within their normal boundaries. Finally,\nconcerning the "pagan" unity of the two powers, spiritual and temporal, this\nwas very far from meaning that they were fused As a "solar" race understood\nit, it expressed the superior rights that must accrue to the spiritual\nauthority at the center of any normal state; thus it was something quite\ndifferent from the emancipation and "supremacy" of a merely secular state. If\nwe were to make similar amendments in the spirit of true objectivity, the\npossibilities would be overwhelming.\\n\\nFurther Misunderstandings Concerning\nthe "Pagan" World-View\\n\\nThis having been said, there remains the real\npossibility of transcending certain aspects of Christianity. But one must be\nquite clear: the Latin term "transcendere" means literally leaving something\nbehind as one rises upwards, and not downwards! It is worth repeating that the\nprincipal thing is not the rejection of Christianity: it is not a matter of\nshowing the same incomprehension towards it as Christianity itself has shown,\nand largely continues to show, towards ancient paganism. It would rather be a\nmatter of completing Christianity by means of a higher and an older heritage,\neliminating some of its aspects and emphasizing other, more important ones, in\nwhich this faith does not necessarily contradict the universal concepts of\npre-Christian spirituality.\\n\\nThis, alas, is not the path taken by the\nradical circles we have mentioned. Many of these neo-pagans seem to have\nfallen into a trap deliberately set for them, often ending up by advocating\nand defending ideas that more or less correspond to that invented, nature-\nbound, particularistic pagandom, lacking light and transcendence, which was\nthe polemical creation of a Christian misunderstanding of the pre-Christian\nworld, and which is based, at most, on a few scattered elements of that world\nin its decline and devolution. And as if this were not enough, people often\nresort to an anti-Catholic polemic which, whatever its political\njustification, often drags out and adapts the old clich\\xc3\\x88s of a purely\nmodern, rationalist and enlightenment type that have been well-used by\nLiberalism, Democracy, and Freemasonry. This was also the case, to a degree,\nwith H. S. Chamberlain, and it appears again in a certain Italian movement\nthat has been trying to connect racial thinking with the "idealistic" doctrine\nof immanence.\\n\\nThere is a general and unmistakable tendency in neo-paganism\nto create a new, superstitious mysticism, based on the glorification of\nimmanence, of Life and Nature, which is in the sharpest contrast to that\nOlympian and heroic ideal of the great Aryan cultures of pre-Christian\nantiquity. It would indicate much more a turning towards the materialistic,\nmaternal, and telluric side, if it did not exhaust itself in foggy and\ndilettantish philosophizing. To give an example, we might ask what exactly is\nmeant by this "Nature," on which these groups are so keen? It is little use to\npoint out that it is certainly not the Nature that was experienced and\nrecognized by ancient, traditional man, but a rational construct of the French\nEncyclopedist period. It was the Encyclopedists who, with definitely\nsubversive and revolutionary motives, made up the myth of Nature as "good,"\nwise, and wholesome, in opposition to the rottenness of every human "Culture."\nThus we can see that the optimistic nature-myth of Rousseau and the\nEncyclopedists marches in the same ranks as "natural right," universalism,\nliberalism, humanitarianism, and the denial of any positive and structured\nform of sovereignty. Moreover, the myth in question has absolutely no basis in\nnatural history. Every honest scientist knows that there is no room for\n"Nature" in the framework of his theories, which have as their object the\ndetermination of purely abstract equivalences and mathematical relationships.\nAs far as biological research and genetics are concerned, we can already see\nthe disequilibrium that would occur the moment one held certain laws to be\nfinal, when they only apply to a partial aspect of reality. What people call\n"Nature" today has nothing to do with what nature meant to the traditional,\nsolar man, or to the knowledge of it that was accessible to such a man thanks\nto his Olympian and regal position. There is no sign of this whatever in the\nadvocates of this new mysticism.\\n\\nMisunderstandings of more or less the same\nkind. arise regarding political thought. Paganism is here often used as the\nsynonym for a merely worldly and yet exclusive concept of sovereignty, which\nturns the relationships upside-down. We have already seen that in the ancient\nstates, the unity of the two powers meant something quite different. It\nprovided the basis for the spiritualization of politics, whereas neo-paganism\nresults in actually politicizing the spiritual, and thereby treading once\nagain the false path of the Gallicans and Jacobins. In contrast, the ancient\nconcept of State and Empire always showed a connection to the Olympian\nidea.\\n\\nWhat shall we think of the attitude that regards Jewry, Rome, the\nCatholic Church, Freemasonry, and Communism as more or less one and the same\nthing, just because their presuppositions differ from the plain thinking of\nthe Folk? The Folk\\\'s thinking along these lines threatens to lose itself in\nthe dark, where no differentiation is possible any more. It shows that it has\nlost the genuine feeling for the hierarchy of values, and that it cannot\nescape the crippling alternative of destructive internationalism and\nnationalistic particularism, whereas the traditional understanding of the\nEmpire is superior to both these concepts.\\n\\nTo restrict ourselves to a\nsingle example: Catholic dogmatism actually fulfils a useful preventive role\nby stopping worldly mysticism and suchlike eruptions from below from passing a\ncertain frontier; it makes a strong dam that protects the area where\ntranscendent knowledge and the genuinely supra-natural and non-human elements\nreign--or at least where they should reign. One may well criticize the way in\nwhich such transcendence and knowledge have been understood in Christianity,\nbut one cannot cross over to a "profane" criticism that seizes on some\npolemical weapon or other, fantasizes over the supposed Aryan nature of the\nimmanence-doctrine, of "natural religion," the cult of "life," etc., without\nreally losing one\\\'s level: in short, one does not thereby attain the world of\nprimordial beginnings, but that of the Counter-Tradition or the telluric and\nprimitive modes of being. This would in fact be the very best way of re-\nconverting those people with the best "pagan" talents to Catholicism!\\n\\nOne\nmust be wary of falling into the misunderstandings and errors that we have\nmentioned, which basically serve only to defend the common enemy. One must try\nto develop the capacity to place oneself at that level where didactic\nconfusion cannot reach, and where all dilettantism and arbitrary intellectual\nactivity are excluded; where one resists energetically every influence from\nconfused, passionate desires and from the aggressive pleasure in polemics;\nwhere, finally and fundamentally, nothing counts but the precise, strict,\nobjective knowledge of the spirit of the Primordial\nTradition.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/1404/pagan.html\'b\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n|\n\\r\\n\n\n# Julius Evola\n\n\\r\\n\n\n## Traditionalist Visionary\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\n\n### Home\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Biography\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Writings\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Traditionalism\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Links\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### About\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\\r\\n\n\nA Sicilian philosopher, occultist, political writer and spiritualist, Julius\nEvola was one of the major advocates of Traditionalism, a philosophy which\nreplaced individual or collective motivation with an appeal toward an eternal\norder which included natural selection.

The motivation for this was the\nsupposed occult background of the Hitler movement. This thesis was first\nproposed in the well-known and very far-fetched book by Pauwels and Bergier,\n"Le Matin des Magiciens" (English ed., "The Dawn of Magic"), in which National\nSocialism was defined as the union of "magical thinking" with technology. The\nexpression used for this was "Tank divisions plus Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Gu\\xc3\\xa9non":\na phrase that might well have caused that eminent representative of\ntraditional thought and esoteric disciplines to turn indignantly in his\ngrave.\\n\\nThe first misunderstanding here is the confusion of the magical\nelement with the mythical, whereas the two have nothing to do with one\nanother. The role of myths in National Socialism is undeniable, for example in\nthe idea of the Reich, the charismatic F\\xc3\\xbchrer, Race, Blood, etc. But\nrather than calling these "myths," one should apply to them Sorel\\\'s concept\nof "motivating energy-ideas" (which is what all the suggestive ideas used by\ndemagogues commonly are), and not attribute to them any magical ingredient.\nSimilarly, no rational person thinks of magic in connection with the myths of\nFascism, such as the myth of Rome or that of the Duce, any more than with\nthose of the French Revolution or Communism. The investigation would proceed\ndifferently if one went on the assumption that certain movements, without\nknowing it, were subject to influences that were not merely human. But this is\nnot the case with the French authors. They are not thinking of influences of\nthat kind, but of a concrete nature, exercised by organizations that really\nexisted, among which were some that to various degrees were "secret."\nLikewise, some have spoken of "unknown superiors" who are supposed to have\ncalled forth the National Socialist movement and to have used Hitler as a\nmedium, though it is unclear what goals they could have had in mind in so\ndoing. If one considers the results, the catastrophic consequences to which\nNational Socialism led, even indirectly, those goals must have been obscure\nand destructive. One would have to identify the "occult side" of this movement\nwith what Gu\\xc3\\xa9non called the "Counter-Initiation." But the French\nauthors have also proposed the thesis that Hitler the "medium" emancipated\nhimself at a certain point from the "unknown superiors," almost like a Golem,\nand that the movement then pursued its fatal direction. But in that case one\nmust admit that these "unknown superiors" can have had no prescience and very\nlimited power, to have been incapable of putting a stop to their supposed\nmedium, Hitler.\\n\\nA lot of fantasy has been woven on the concrete level about\nthe origin of National Socialism\\\'s themes and symbols. Reference has been\nmade to certain organizations as forerunners, but ones to which it is very\ndifficult to attribute any genuine and factual initiatic character. There is\nno doubt that Hitler did not invent German racial doctrine, the symbol of the\nswastika, or Aryan antisemitism: all of these had long existed in Germany. A\nbook entitled "Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab" [The man who gave Hitler\nhis ideas] reports on J\\xc3\\xb6rg Lanz von Liebenfels (the title of nobility\nwas self-bestowed), who had formerly been a Cistercian monk and had founded an\nOrder that already used the swastika; Lanz edited the periodical "Ostara" from\n1905 onwards, which Hitler certainly knew, in which the Aryan and antisemitic\nracial theories were already clearly worked out.\\n\\nBut much more important\nfor the "occult background" of National Socialism is the role of the Thule\nSociety. Things are more complex here. This society grew out of the\nGermanenorden, founded in 1912, and was led by Rudolf von Sebottendorf, who\nhad been in the East and had published a strange booklet on "Die Praxis der\nalten t\\xc3\\xbcrkischen Freimaurerei" [The practice of ancient Turkish\nFreemasonry]. Practices were described therein that involved the repetition of\nsyllables, gestures, and steps, whose goal was the initiatic transformation of\nman, such as alchemy had also aimed at. It is unclear what Turkish masonic\norganization Sebottendorf was in contact with, and also whether he himself\npracticed the things in question, or merely described them.\\n\\nMoreover, it\ncannot be established whether these practices were employed in the Thule\nSociety that Sebottendorf headed. It would be very important to know that,\nbecause many top-ranking National Socialist personalities, from Hitler to\nRudolf Hess, frequented this society. In a way, Hitler was already introduced\nto the world of ideas of the Thule Society by Hess during their imprisonment\ntogether after the failed Munich Putsch.\\n\\nAt all events, it must be\nemphasized that the Thule Society was less an initiatic organization than it\nwas a secret society, which already bore the swastika and was marked by a\ndecided antisemitism and by Germanic racial thinking. One should be cautious\nabout the thesis that the name Thule is a serious and conscious reference to a\nNordic, Polar connection, in the effort to make a connection with the\nHyperborean origins of the Indo-Germans--since Thule appears in ancient\ntradition as the sacred center or sacred island in the uttermost North. Thule\nmay just be a play on the name "Thale," a location in the Harz where the\nGermanenorden held a conference in 1914, at which it was decided to create a\nsecret "v\\xc3\\xb6lkisch" band to combat the supposed Jewish International.\nAbove all, these ideas were emphasized by Sebottendorf in his book "Bevor\nHitler kam" [Before Hitler came], published in Munich in 1933, in which he\nindicated the myths and the "v\\xc3\\xb6lkisch" world-view that existed before\nHitler.\\n\\nThus a serious investigation into Hitler\\\'s initiatic connections\nwith secret societies does not lead far. A few explanations are necessary in\nregard to Hitler as a "medium" and his attractive power. It seems to us pure\nfantasy that he owed this power to initiatic practices. Otherwise one would\nhave to assume the same about the psychic power of other leaders, like\nMussolini and Napoleon, which is absurd. It is much better to go on the\nassumption that there is a psychic vortex that arises from mass movements, and\nthat this concentrates on the man in the center and lends him a certain\nradiation that is felt especially by suggestible people.\\n\\nThe quality of\nmedium (which, to put it bluntly, is the antithesis of an initiatic\nqualification) can be attributed to Hitler with a few reservations, because in\na certain respect he did appear as one possessed (which differentiates him\nfrom Mussolini, for example). When he whipped up the masses to fanaticism, one\nhad the impression that another force was directing him as a medium, even\nthough he was a man of a very extraordinary kind, and extremely gifted. Anyone\nwho has heard Hitler\\\'s addresses to the enraptured masses can have no other\nimpression. Since we have already expressed our reservations about the\nassumption that "unknown superiors" were involved, it is not easy to define\nthe nature of this supra-personal force. In respect to National Socialist\ntheosophy [Gotteserkenntnis], i.e. to its supposed mystical and metaphysical\ndimension, one must realize the unique juxtaposition in this movement and in\nthe Third Reich of mythical, Enlightenment, and even scientific aspects. In\nHitler, one can find many symptoms of a typically "modern" world-view that was\nfundamentally profane, naturalistic, and materialistic; while on the other\nhand he believed in Providence, whose tool he believed himself to be,\nespecially in regard to the destiny of the German nation. (For example, he saw\na sign of Providence in his survival of the assassination attempt in his East-\nPrussian headquarters.) Alfred Rosenberg, the ideologist of the movement,\nproclaimed the myth of Blood, in which he spoke of the "mystery" of Nordic\nblood and attributed to it a sacramental value; yet he simultaneously attacked\nall the rites and sacraments of Catholicism as delusions, just like a man of\nthe Enlightenment. He railed against the "Dark men of our time," while\nattributing to Aryan man the merit of having created modern science. National\nSocialism\\\'s concern with runes, the ancient Nordic-Germanic letter-signs,\nmust be regarded as purely symbolic, rather like the Fascist use of certain\nRoman symbols, and without any esoteric significance. The program of National\nSocialism to create a higher man has something of "biological mysticism" about\nit, but this again was a scientific project. At best, it might have been a\nquestion of the "superman" in Nietzsche\\\'s sense, but never of a higher man in\nthe initiatic sense.\\n\\nThe plan to "create a new racial, religious, and\nmilitary Order of initiates, assembled around a divinized F\\xc3\\xbchrer,"\ncannot be regarded as the official policy of National Socialism, as\nRen\\xc3\\xa9 Alleau writes, when he presents such a relationship and even\ncompares it, among others, to the Ishmaelites of Islam. A few elements of a\nhigher level were visible only in the ranks of the SS.\\n\\nIn the first place,\none can see clearly the intention of Reichsf\\xc3\\xbchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler\nto create an Order in which elements of Prussian ethics were to be combined\nwith those of the old Orders of knighthood, especially the Teutonic Order. He\nwas looking for legitimation of such an organization, but could not obtain it,\nsince these old Orders of Catholicism were openly opposed by the radical wing\nof National Socialism. Himmler was also seeking, without the possibility of\nany traditional connection, a relationship to the Nordic-Hyperborean heritage\nand its symbolism (Thule), albeit without those "secret societies" discussed\nabove having any influence over it. He took notice, as did Rosenberg, of the\nresearches of the Netherlander Herman Wirth into the Nordic-Atlantic\ntradition. Later Himmler founded, with Wirth, the research and teaching\norganization called the "Ahnenerbe." This is not without interest, but there\nwas no "occult background" to it.\\n\\nSo the net result is negative. The French\nauthors\\\' fantasy reaches its high point in the book "Hitler et la tradition\ncathare" by Jean-Michel Angebert (Paris, 1971). This deals with the Cathars,\nalso called Albigensians, who were a heretical sect that spread especially in\nSouthern France between the 11th and 12th centuries, and had their center in\nthe fortress of Monts\\xc3\\xa9gur. According to Otto Rahn, this was destroyed\nin a "crusade against the Grail," which is the title of one of his books.\nWhatever the Grail and its Grail-Knights had to do with this sect remains\ncompletely in the dark. The sect was marked by a kind of fanatical Manicheism:\nsometimes its own believers would die of hunger or some other cause as a\ndemonstration of their detachment from the world and their hostility to\nearthly existence in flesh and matter. Now it is assumed that Rahn, with whom\nwe corresponded during his lifetime and tried to persuade of the baselessness\nof his thesis, was an SS man, and that an expedition was sent on its way to\nretrieve the legendary Grail which was supposedly brought to safety at the\nmoment when the Cathars\\\' fortress in Monts\\xc3\\xa9gur was destroyed. After\nthe fall of Berlin, a unit is said to have reached the Zillertal and hidden\nthis object at the foot of a glacier, to await a new age.\\n\\nThe truth is that\nthere was talk of a commando unit, which however had a less mystical\ncommission, namely the rescue and concealment of the Reich\\\'s treasures. Two\nfurther examples show what such fantasies can lead to when they are given free\nrein. The SS (which included not only battle units but also researchers and\nscholarly experts) mounted an expedition to Tibet in order to make discoveries\nin the fields of alpinism and ethnology, and another one to the Arctic,\nostensibly for scientific research but also with a view to the possible\nsituation of a German military base.

Here we can only point to what we believe\nmust be the form and the spiritual and doctrinal basis of united\nEurope.\\n\\n\'Federalist\' and \'associative\' solutions, economic and military co-\noperation\\xe2\\x80\\x94 these are all the manifestation of presuppositions about\nthe organic character of Europe (or the lack of it). The condition of a truly\nEuropean entity must be the binding force of an idea and tradition with which\nEurope is irrevocably linked. Some argue that the nation state, being not\ndivinely ordained but the creation of determined groups successfully rising to\na historical challenge, is a model for the merging European nation. According\nto this view the spiritual precondition for a united Europe exists in the myth\nof a common destiny defended by the \'national revolutionary\' groups of Europe.\nThis view is inadequate. The birth of the European nations was largely the\nwork of dynasties representing a tradition of loyalty to a particular crown.\nIn any case, the factors which created the European nations have been the very\nones which have maintained European disunity from the Hundred Years War to the\npresent day.\\n\\nAmong those who possess a spiritual and traditional\nunderstanding of Europe we can distinguish between those who believe in an\nImperium of the kind referred to above, and those who talk of Europe as a\nnation. The concept of nationhood is in my opinion inappropriate. The notion\nof European unity is spiritual and supranational. Homeland nation, ethnic\ngroup subsist at an essentially naturalistic \'physical\' level. Europe (Europa\nuna) should be something more than this. The old nationalisms and resentments\nare only grafted onto Europe when a particular national domination is imposed\nby one nation upon the rest of Europe. The European Imperium will belong to a\nhigher order than the parts which compose it, and to be European should be\nconceived as being something qualitatively different from being Italian,\nPrussian, Basque, Finnish, Scottish or Hungarian, something which appeals to a\ndifferent aspect of our character. A European nation implies the levelling and\ncancelling of all \'rival\' nations in or beyond Europe.\\n\\nSo far as \'European\nculture\' is concerned it is these days the stamping-ground of the pragmatic\nEuropean, the liberal, humanist intellectual. His \'European culture\' is an\nappendage of \'democracy\' and the \'Free World\'. In this sense \'culture\' is the\nstock-in-trade of the so-called \'aristocrat of thought\', in reality the\nclothing of the parvenu, his badge of success. A genuine aristocracy of the\nintellect would not in any case be adequate for the task in hand; the re-\nanimation of the European will and the sustaining of a revolutionary elite who\ncould make this a political possibility. What is more, every time that we try\nto give the notion of \'European culture\' concrete significance, we seem to run\nup against innumerable \'interpretations\' which leave us with nothing\nconclusive at all. Everyone has their own idea about what European culture is\nand many Europeans feel reticent or even guilty about championing it and so\nthe parvenus can speculate to their hearts\' content in the reviews and colour\nsupplements about all the latest developments in this or that field of art in\nsuch a way that \'culture\' becomes entirely divorced from the \'serious world\',\nfrom what matters. Ironically, much of what the defenders of culture admire\nplays a major role in helping to bring about a spiritual crisis and lack of\nconfidence in European culture.\\n\\nThe \'Westernisation\' of the world has meant\nthat this decomposition extends across the world\\xe2\\x80\\x94thus Europe, from\nilluminism to communism has become the breeding ground of the very forces\nwhich work to destroy everything which is specifically European.\\n\\nWe must\ncreate a \'unity of fighters\'. That is a pre-requisite. To set a vision of the\nworld and of Europe aside as \'irrelevant\' would be to sink into the morass of\npolitical partisan politics, a cynical affair without identity, without\nspiritual meaning. A united Europe, without a communal spiritual identity and\nsense of direction would become just one more power bloc. In what way would\nsuch a United States of Europe be spiritually distinct from the United States\nof America or China or be anything nobler than the organisation of African\nUnity? Europe must not be a stage towards the Westernisation of the world but\na move against it, in fact a revolt against the modern world in favour of what\nis nobler, higher, more truly\nhuman.\\n\\nhttp://www.oswaldmosley.com/people/evola.html"b\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n|\n\\r\\n\n\n# Julius Evola\n\n\\r\\n\n\n## Traditionalist Visionary\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\n\n### Home\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Biography\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Writings\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Traditionalism\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### Links\n\n\\r\\n\n\n### About\n\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| \\r\\n\\r\\n\n\nA Sicilian philosopher, occultist, political writer and spiritualist, Julius\nEvola was one of the major advocates of Traditionalism, a philosophy which\nreplaced individual or collective motivation with an appeal toward an eternal\norder which included natural selection.
