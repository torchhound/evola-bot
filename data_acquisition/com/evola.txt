b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfAmerican "Civilisation"\\n\\nThe recently deceased John Dewey was\napplauded by the American press as the most representative figure of American\ncivilisation. This is quite right. His theories are entirely representative of\nthe vision of man and life which is the premise of Americanism and its\n\\\'democracy\\\'.\\n\\nThe essence of such theories is this: that everyone can\nbecome what he wants to, within the limits of the technological means at his\ndisposal. Equally, a person is not what he is from his true nature and there\nis no real difference between people, only differences in qualifications.\nAccording to this theory anyone can be anyone he wants to be if he knows how\nto train himself.\\n\\nThis is obviously the case with the \\\'self-made man\\\'; in\na society which has lost all sense of tradition the notion of personal\naggrandisement will extend into every aspect of human existence, reinforcing\nthe egalitarian doctrine of pure democracy. If the basis of such ideas is\naccepted, then all natural diversity has to be abandoned. Each person can\npresume to possess the potential of everyone else and the terms \\\'superior\\\'\nand \\\'inferior\\\' lose their meaning; every notion of distance and respect\nloses meaning; all life-styles are open to all. To all organic conceptions of\nlife Americans oppose a mechanistic conception. In a society which has\n\\\'started from scratch\\\', everything has the characteristic of being\nfabricated. In American society appearances are masks not faces. At the same\ntime, proponents of the American way of life are hostile to\npersonality.\\n\\nThe Americans\\\' \\\'open-mindedness\\\', which is sometimes cited\nin their favour, is the other side of their interior formlessness. The same\ngoes for their \\\'individualism\\\'. Individualism and personality are not the\nsame: the one belongs to the formless world of quantity, the other to the\nworld of quality and hierarchy. The Americans are the living refutation of the\nCartesian axiom, "I think, therefore I am": Americans do not think, yet they\nare. The American \\\'mind\\\', puerile and primitive, lacks characteristic form\nand is therefore open to every kind of standardisation.\\n\\nIn a superior\ncivilisation, as, for example, that of the Indo-Aryans, the being who is\nwithout a characteristic form or caste (in the original meaning of the word),\nnot even that of servant or shudra, would emerge as a pariah. In this respect\nAmerica is a society of pariahs. There is a role for pariahs. It is to be\nsubjected to beings whose form and internal laws are precisely defined.\nInstead the modern pariahs seek to become dominant themselves and to exercise\ntheir dominion over all the world.\\n\\nThere is a popular notion about the\nUnited States that it is a \\\'young nation\\\' with a \\\'great future before it\\\'.\nApparent American defects are then described as the \\\'faults of youth\\\' or\n\\\'growing pains\\\'. It is not difficult to see that the myth of \\\'progress\\\'\nplays a large part in this judgement. According to the idea that everything\nnew is good, America has a privileged role to play among civilised nations. In\nthe First World War the United States intervened in the role of \\\'the\ncivilised world\\\' par excellence. The \\\'most evolved\\\' nation had not only a\nright but a duty to interfere in the destinies of other peoples.\\n\\nThe\nstructure of history is, however, cyclical not evolutionary. It is far from\nbeing the case that the most recent civilisations are necessarily\n\\\'superior\\\'. They may be, in fact, senile and decadent. There is a necessary\ncorrespondence between the most advanced stages of a historical cycle and the\nmost primitive. America is the final stage of modern Europe. Guenon called the\nUnited States \\\'the far West\\\', in the novel sense that the United States\nrepresents the reductio ad absurdum of the negative and the most senile\naspects of Western civilisation. What in Europe exist in diluted form are\nmagnified and concentrated in the United States whereby they are revealed as\nthe symptoms of disintegration and cultural and human regression. The American\nmentality can only be interpreted as an example of regression, which shows\nitself in the mental atrophy towards all higher interests and incomprehension\nof higher sensibility. The American mind has limited horizons, one conscribed\nto e! veryth ing which is immediate and simplistic, with the inevitable\nconsequence that everything is made banal, basic and levelled down until it is\ndeprived of all spiritual life. Life itself in American terms is entirely\nmechanistic. The sense of \\\'I\\\' in America belongs entirely to the physical\nlevel of existence. The typical American neither has spiritual dilemmas nor\ncomplications: he is a \\\'natural\\\' joiner and conformist.\\n\\nThe primitive\nAmerican mind can only superficially be compared to a young mind. The American\nmind is a feature of the regressive society to which I have already\nreferred.\\n\\nAmerican Morality\\n\\nThe much-vaunted sex appeal of American\nwomen is drawn from films, reviews and pin-ups, and is in large print\nfictitious. A recent medical survey in the United States showed that 75 per\ncent of young American women are without strong sexual feeling and instead of\nsatisfying their libido they seek pleasure narcissistically in exhibitionism,\nvanity and the cult of fitness and health in a sterile sense. American girls\nhave \\\'no hang-ups about sex\\\'; they are \\\'easy going\\\' for the man who sees\nthe whole sexual process as something in isolation thereby making it\nuninteresting and matter-of-fact, which, at such a level, it is meant to be.\nThus, after she has been taken to the cinema or a dance, it is something like\nAmerican good manners for the girl to let herself be kissed - this doesn\\\'t\nmean anything. American women are characteristically frigid and materialistic.\nThe man who \\\'has his way\\\' with an American girl is under a material\nobligation to her. The woman has granted a materia! l favour. In cases of\ndivorce American law overwhelmingly favours the woman. American women will\ndivorce readily enough when they see a better bargain. It is frequently the\ncase in America that a woman will be married to one man but already\n\\\'engaged\\\' to a future husband, the man she plans to marry after a profitable\ndivorce.\\n\\n"Our" American Media\\n\\nAmericanisation in Europe is widespread\nand evident. In Italy it is a phenomenon which is rapidly developing in these\npost-war years and is considered by most people, if not enthusiastically, at\nleast as something natural. Some time ago I wrote that of the two great\ndangers confronting Europe - Americanism and Communism - the first is the more\ninsidious. Communism cannot be a danger other than in the brutal and\ncatastrophic form of a direct seizure of power by communists. On the other\nhand Americanisation gains ground by a process of gradual infiltration,\neffecting modifications of mentalities and customs which seem inoffensive in\nthemselves but which end in a fundamental perversion and degradation against\nwhich it is impossible to fight other than within oneself.\\n\\nIt is precisely\nwith respect to such internal opposition that most Italians seem weak.\nForgetting their own cultural inheritance they readily turn to the United\nStates as something akin to the parent guide of the world. Whoever wants to be\nmodern has to measure himself according to the American standard. It is\npitiable to witness a European country so debase itself. Veneration for\nAmerica has nothing to do with a cultured interest in the way other people\nlive. On the contrary, servility towards the United States leads one to think\nthat there is no other way of life worth considering on the same level as the\nAmerican one.\\n\\nOur radio service is Americanised. Without any criterion of\nsuperior and inferior it just follows the fashionable themes of the moment and\nmarkets what is considered \\\'acceptable\\\' - acceptable, that is, to the most\nAmericanised section of the public, which is to say the most degenerate. The\nrest of us are dragged along in its wake. Even the style of presentation on\nradio has become Americanised. "Who, after listening to an American radio\nprogramme, can suppress a shudder when he considers that the only way of\nescaping communism is by becoming Americanised?" Those are not the words of an\noutsider but of an American sociologist, James Burnham, professor at the\nUniversity of Princeton. Such a judgement from an American should make Italian\nradio programmers blush for shame.\\n\\nThe consequence of the \\\'do your own\nthing\\\' democracy is the intoxication of the greater part of the population\nwhich is not capable of discriminating for itself, which, when not guided by a\npower and an ideal, all too easily loses sense of its own identity.\\n\\nThe\nIndustrial Order in America\\n\\nIn his classic study of capitalism Werner\nSombart summarised the late capitalist phase in the adage Fiat producto,\npareat homo. In its extreme form capitalism is a system in which a man\\\'s\nvalue is estimated solely in terms of the production of merchandise and the\ninvention of the means of production. Socialist doctrines grew out of a\nreaction to the lack of human consideration in this system.\\n\\nA new phase has\nbegun in the United States where there has been an upsurge of interest in so-\ncalled labor relations. In appearance it would seem to signify an improvement:\nin reality this is a deleterious phenomenon. The entrepreneurs and employers\nhave come to realise the importance of the \\\'human factor\\\' in a productive\neconomy, and that it is a mistake to ignore the individual involved in\nindustry: his motives, his feelings, his working day life. Thus, a whole\nschool of study of human relations in industry has grown up, based on\nbehaviourism. Studies like Human Relations in Industry by B. Gardner and G.\nMoore have supplied a minute analysis of the behaviour of employees and their\nmotivations with the precise aim of defining the best means to obviate all\nfactors that can hinder the maximisation of production. Some studies certainly\ndon\\\'t come from the shop floor but from the management, abetted by\nspecialists from various colleges. The sociological investigations go as far!\nas analysing the employee\\\'s social ambience. This kind of study has a\npractical purpose: the ma intenance of the psychological contentment of the\nemployee is as important as the physical. In cases in which a worker is tied\nto a monotonous job which doesn\\\'t demand a great deal of concentration, the\nstudies will draw attention to the \\\'danger\\\' that his mind may tend to wander\nin a way that may eventually reflect badly on his attitude towards the\njob.\\n\\nThe private lives of employees are not forgotten - hence the increase\nin so-called personnel counselling. Specialists are called in to dispel\nanxiety, psychological disturbances and non-adaptation \\\'complexes\\\', even to\nthe point of giving advice in relation to the most personal matters. A frankly\npsycho-analytic technique and one much used is to make the subject \\\'talk\nfreely\\\' and put the results obtainable by this \\\'catharsis\\\' into\nrelief.\\n\\nNone of this is concerned with the spiritual betterment of human\nbeings or any real human problems, such as a European would understand them in\nthis "age of economics". On the other side of the Iron Curtain man is treated\nas a beast of burden and his obedience is maintained by terror and famine. In\nthe United States man is also seen as just a factor of labour and consumption,\nand no aspect of his interior life is neglected and every factor of his\nexistence is drawn to the same end. In the \\\'Land of the Free\\\', through every\nmedium, man is told he has reached a degree of happiness hitherto undreamed\nof. He forgets who he is, where he came from, and basks in the\npresent.\\n\\nAmerican "Democracy" in Industry\\n\\nThere is a significant and\ngrowing discrepancy in the United States between the shibboleths of the\nprevailing political ideology and the effective economic structures of the\nnation. A large part of studies of the subject is played by the \\\'morphology\nof business\\\'. Studies corroborate the impression that American business is a\nlong way from the type of organisation which corresponds to the democratic\nideal of U.S. propaganda. American businesses have a \\\'pyramid\\\' structure.\nThey constitute at the top an articulate hierarchy. The big businesses are run\nin the same way as government ministries and are organised along similar\nlines. They have co-ordinating and controlling bodies which separate the\nbusiness leaders from the mass of employees. Rather than becoming more\nflexible in a social sense the "managerial elite" (Burnham) is becoming more\nautocratic than ever - something not unrelated to American foreign\npolicy.\\n\\nThis is the end of yet another American illusion. America: the\n\\\'land of opportunity\\\', where every possibility is there for the person who\ncan grasp it, a land where anyone can rise from rags to riches. At first there\nwas the \\\'open frontier\\\' for all to ride out across. That closed and the new\n\\\'open frontier\\\' was the sky, the limitless potential of industry and\ncommerce. As Gardner, Moore and many others have shown, this too is no longer\nlimitless, and the opportunities are thinning out. Given the ever increasing\nspecialisation of labour in the productive process and the increasing emphasis\non \\\'qualifications\\\', what used to seem obvious to Americans - that their\nchildren would \\\'go further\\\' than they would - is for many people no longer\nobvious at all. Thus it is that in the so-called political democracy of the\nUnited States, the force and the power in the land, that is to say the\nindustry and the economy, are becoming ever more self-evidently undemocratic.\nThe problem then is! : should reality be made to fit ideology or vice-versa?\nUntil recently the overwhelming demand has been for the former course of\naction; the cry goes out for a return to the \\\'real America\\\' of unfettered\nenterprise and the individual free of central government control.\nNevertheless, there are also those who would prefer to limit democracy in\norder to adapt political theory to commercial reality. If the mask of American\n\\\'democracy\\\' were thereby removed, it would become clear to what extent\n\\\'democracy\\\' in America (and elsewhere) is only the instrument of an\noligarchy which pursues a method of \\\'indirect action\\\', assuring the\npossibility of abuse and deception on a large scale of those many who accept a\nhierarchical system because they think it is justly such. This dilemma of\n\\\'democracy\\\' in the United States may one day give place to some interesting\ndevelopments.\\n\\nComments of New Dawn stuff\\n\\nIn 1945 Julius Evola\\\'s\n"Civilta Americana" was published. Evola\\\'s critique was an attack on the\nAmerican way of life. Aside from a few passages in Rivolta contro il mondo\nmoderno it contained all the important aspects of his analysis of American\nsociety. For some time out of print, "Civilta" Americana was reprinted in the\nearly eighties by the Julius Evola Foundation (Corso Vittorio Emanuele 197 -\nRome) and published with an unsigned preface (included below). It has been\nedited and abridged.\\n\\nWe can only imagine what Evola would write if he were\nalive today to see the putrification of modern American society.\\n\\nThis essay\non America was written at a time when the United States was seen as the\nleading nation of the world and the model of civilisation. After the Second\nWorld War history seemed to have invested the future of humanity in the\ndoctrines and values of Russia and America. On the one side was the Soviet\nUnion, the pure incarnation of the proletarian ideal; on the other side the\nUnited States, offering the most out-and-out bourgeois ideology the world had\nyet seen. These two ideals were shown to the world as two opposed and\nirreconcilable models of existence, of two global alternatives in terms of\nideology, social organisation and culture; but in an article published in 1929\nand in Rivolta contro il mondo moderno (Revolt against the modern world),\nEvola had already put in relief the analogy between the two systems. Over and\nabove the obvious differences of race, of mentality and temperament, and of\nhistorical background, there was a perceptible correspondence betwe! en the\ntwo kinds of system: the meaninglessness of life centred on the economic and\nproductive sphere of existence; the tendency towards the mechanisation and\ndepersonalisation of every human activity; the collectivisation of large\nmasses of individuals enervated by the rhythms of a frenetic, restless\nsociety; the negation of any notion of transcendence (in the one case by means\nof a dull, state-imposed atheism; in the other case through reducing the\nreligious perspective to a banal, moralistic facade); the formless and\nsoulless character of the arts; the utilisation of all intellectual resources\nfor the purpose of encouraging a solely external and quantitative growth.\nBetween two supposedly opposed systems Evola maintained that there existed\nonly one essential distinction to be made: this relates exclusively to the\nnature of political power within the two systems and therefore to their mode\nof procedure in pursuing what is in fact a programme common to both. The\nbureaucratic Sovi! et dictatorship imposes a mortifying and grey view of life\nby means of brash propaganda and the adoption of brutal means of\nadministration which attack every conceivable human right including armed\nrepression of popular dissent. In the \\\'democratic\\\' and capitalist United\nStates the same ends are obtained by a fatalistic notion of the \\\'inevitable\\\'\ndevelopment of society which is realised at the moment that man is severed\nfrom all links with a deeper spiritual reality and becomes absorbed into an\nanaemic unidimensional vision of existence. In that sense the American model\nof existence can be argued to be more insidious than the Marxist one.\\n\\nEvola\ncharges American society with creating a totally vacuous kind of human being,\nwhose terms of reference are exclusively related to personal enrichment,\nwhether financial or \\\'psychological\\\'; one incapable of autonomous choice, an\nabject conformist; someone who has been made crass and incapable by a\nmaterially easy life which is without idealist impulse. Far from being the\nacme of human progress, American society is in fact at the most advanced stage\nof disintegration of modern civilisation. It is so because in America\nregression is taking place at every social level and is neither contained by\nany solid barrier nor challenged by any significant resistance: it is a\nspontaneous and natural development which is now permeating the whole of the\nWestern world.\\n\\nAnyone today who considers American society disinterestedly\nis struck by the impression of a society gone mad, in which the germs of\ndisintegration which Evola pointed to have multiplied and the disease has\nbroken out visibly, defacing a social fabric which was already deteriorating.\nAccording to official statistics more than one fifth of the population of the\nUnited States has been involved with drugs. Organised delinquent hooliganism\nis still on the increase and has come to dominate large areas of some cities;\nevery kind of sexual aberration is being advocated along with an unbridled\nsexual grossness; there is increasing violence and sadism in the cities,\nparticularly among the young; pseudo-religious sects proliferate, dragging\ntheir disciples into a psychological slum world. These phenomena are only the\nmost obviously disquieting symptoms of an accelerating decline towards the\ntotal disintegration of human personality.\\n\\nAccording to traditionalist\ndoctrine as espoused by Evola, American society, in fact, is on an\nirreversible course to extinction.\\n\\nSource:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/6824/evola.htm\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfOn the Secret of Degeneration\\nBy Baron Julius Evola (from\nDeutsches Volkstum, Nr. 11, 1938)\\n\\nAnyone who has come to reject the\nrationalist myth of "progress" and the interpretation of history as an\nunbroken positive development of mankind will find himself gradually drawn\ntowards the world-view that was common to all the great traditional cultures,\nand which had at its centre the memory of a process of degeneration, slow\nobscuration, or collapse of a higher preceding world. As we penetrate deeper\ninto this new (and old) interpretation, we encounter various problems,\nforemost among which is the question of the secret of degeneration.\\n\\nIn its\nliteral sense, this question is by no means a novel one. While contemplating\nthe magnificent remains of cultures whose very name has not even come down to\nus, but which seem to have conveyed, even in their physical material, a\ngreatness and power that is more than earthly, scarcely anyone has failed to\nask themselves questions about the death of cultures, and sensed the\ninadequacy of the reasons that are usually given to explain it.\\n\\nWe can\nthank the Comte de Gobineau for the best and best-known summary of this\nproblem, and also for a masterly criticism of the main hypotheses about it.\nHis solution on the basis of racial thought and racial purity also has a lot\nof truth in it, but it needs to be expanded by a few observations concerning a\nhigher order of things. For there have been many cases in which a culture has\ncollapsed even when its race has remained pure, as is especially clear in\ncertain groups that have suffered slow, inexorable extinction despite\nremaining as racially isolated as if they were islands. An example quite close\nat hand is the case of the Swedes and the Dutch. These people are in the same\nracial condition today as they were two centuries ago, but there is little to\nbe found now of the heroic disposition and the racial awareness that they once\npossessed. Other great cultures seem merely to have remained standing in the\ncondition of mummies: they have long been inwardly dead, so that it takes only\nthe slightest push to knock them down. This was the case, for example, with\nancient Peru, that giant solar empire which was annihilated by a few\nadventurers drawn from the worst rabble of Europe.\\n\\nIf we look at the secret\nof degeneration from the exclusively traditional point of view, it becomes\neven harder to solve it completely. It is then a matter of the division of all\ncultures into two main types. On the one hand there are the traditional\ncultures, whose principle is identical and unchangeable, despite all the\ndifferences evident on the surface. The axis of these cultures and the summit\nof their hierarchical order consists of metaphysical, supra-individual powers\nand actions, which serve to inform and justify everything that is merely\nhuman, temporal, subject to becoming and to "history." On the other hand there\nis "modern culture," which is actually the anti-tradition and which exhausts\nitself in a construction of purely human and earthly conditions and in the\ntotal development of these, in pursuit of a life entirely detached from the\n"higher world."\\n\\nFrom the standpoint of the latter, the whole of history is\ndegeneration, because it shows the universal decline of earlier cultures of\nthe traditional type, and the decisive and violent rise of a new universal\ncivilization of the "modern" type.\\n\\nA double question arises from\nthis.\\n\\nFirst, how was it ever possible for this to come to pass? There is a\nlogical error underlying the whole doctrine of evolution: it is impossible\nthat the higher can emerge from the lower, and the greater from the less. But\ndoesn\\\'t a similar difficulty face us in the solution of the doctrine of\ninvolution? How is it ever possible for the higher to fall? If we could make\ndo with simple analogies, it would be easy to deal with this question. A\nhealthy man can become sick; a virtuous one can turn to vice. There is a\nnatural law that everyone takes from granted: that every living being starts\nwith birth, growth, and strength, then come old age, weakening, and\ndisintegration. And so forth. But this is just making statements, not\nexplaining, even if we allow that such analogies actually relate to the\nquestion posed here.\\n\\nSecondly, it is not only a matter of explaining the\npossibility of the degeneration of a particular cultural world, but also the\npossibility that the degeneration of one cultural cycle may pass to other\npeoples and take them down with it. For example, we have not only to explain\nhow the ancient Western reality collapsed, but also have to show the reason\nwhy it was possible for "modern" culture to conquer practically the whole\nworld, and why it possessed the power to divert so many peoples from any other\ntype of culture, and to hold sway even where states of a traditional kind\nseemed to be alive (one need only recall the Aryan East).\\n\\nIn this respect,\nit is not enough to say that we are dealing with a purely material and\neconomic conquest. That view seems very superficial, for two reasons. In the\nfirst place, a land that is conquered on the material level also experiences,\nin the long run, influences of a higher kind corresponding to the cultural\ntype of its conqueror. We can state, in fact, that European conquest almost\neverywhere sows the seeds of "Europeanization," i.e., the "modern"\nrationalist, tradition-hostile, individualistic way of thinking. Secondly, the\ntraditional conception of culture and the state is hierarchical, not\ndualistic. Its bearers could never subscribe, without severe reservations, to\nthe principles of "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\\\'s" and "My\nkingdom is not of this world." For us, "Tradition" is the victorious and\ncreative presence in the world of that which is "not of this world," i.e., of\nthe Spirit, understood as a power that is mightier than any merely human or\nmaterial one.\\n\\nThis is a basic idea of the authentically traditional view of\nlife, which does not permit us to speak with contempt of merely material\nconquests. On the contrary, the material conquest is the sign, if not of a\nspiritual victory, at least of a spiritual weakness or a kind of spiritual\n"retreat" in the cultures that are conquered and lose their independence.\nEverywhere that the Spirit, regarded as the stronger power, was truly present,\nit never lacked for means - visible or otherwise - to enable all the\nopponent\\\'s technical and material superiority to be resisted. But this has\nnot happened. It must be concluded, then, that degeneracy was lurking behind\nthe traditional facade of every people that the "modern" world has been able\nto conquer. The West must then have been the culture in which a crisis that\nwas already universal assumed its acutest form. There the degeneration\namounted, so to speak, to a knockout blow, and as it took effect, it brought\ndown with more or less ease other peoples in whom the involution had certainly\nnot "progressed" as far, but whose tradition had already lost its original\npower, so that these peoples were no longer able to protect themselves from an\noutside assault.\\n\\nWith these considerations, the second aspect of our\nproblem is traced back to the first one. It is mainly a question of\nexplicating the meaning and the possibility of degeneracy, without reference\nto other circumstances.\\n\\nFor this we must be clear about one thing: it is an\nerror to assume that the hierarchy of the traditional world is based on a\ntyranny of the upper classes. That is merely a "modern" conception, completely\nalien to the traditional way of thinking. The traditional doctrine in fact\nconceived of spiritual action as an "action without acting"; it spoke of the\n"unmoved mover"; everywhere it used the symbolism of the "pole," the\nunalterable axis around which every ordered movement takes place (and\nelsewhere we have shown that this is the meaning of the swastika, the "arctic\ncross"); it always stressed the "Olympian," spirituality, and genuine\nauthority, as well as its way of acting directly on its subordinates, not\nthrough violence but through "presence"; finally, it used the simile of the\nmagnet, wherein lies the key to our question, as we shall now see.\\n\\nOnly\ntoday could anyone imagine that the authentic bearers of the Spirit, or of\nTradition, pursue people so as to seize them and put them in their places - in\nshort, that they "manage" people, or have any personal interest in setting up\nand maintaining those hierarchical relationships by virtue of which they can\nappear visibly as the rulers. This would be ridiculous and senseless. It is\nmuch more the recognition on the part of the lower ones that is the true basis\nof any traditional ranking. It is not the higher that needs the lower, but the\nother way round. The essence of hierarchy is that there is something living as\na reality in certain people, which in the rest is only present in the\ncondition of an ideal, a premonition, an unfocused effort. Thus the latter are\nfatefully attracted to the former, and their lower condition is one of\nsubordination less to something foreign, than to their own true "self." Herein\nlies the secret, in the traditional world, of all readiness for sacrifice, all\nheroism, all loyalty; and, on the other side, of a prestige, an authority, and\na calm power which the most heavily-armed tyrant can never count upon.\\n\\nWith\nthese considerations, we have come very close to solving not only the problem\nof degeneration, but also the possibility of a particular fall. Are we perhaps\nnot tired of hearing that the success of every revolution indicates the\nweakness and degeneracy of the previous rulers? An understanding of this kind\nis very one-sided. This would indeed be the case if wild dogs were tied up,\nand suddenly broke loose: that would be proof that the hands holding their\nleashes had become impotent or weak. But things are arranged very differently\nin the framework of spiritual ranking, whose real basis we have explained\nabove. This hierarchy degenerates and is able to be overthrown in one case\nonly: when the individual degenerates, when he uses his fundamental freedom to\ndeny the Spirit, to cut his life loose from any higher reference-point, and to\nexist "only for himself." Then the contacts are fatefully broken, the\nmetaphysical tension, to which the traditional organism owes its unity, gives\nway, every force wavers in its path and finally breaks free. The peaks, of\ncourse, remain pure and inviolable in their heights, but the rest, which\ndepended on them, now becomes an avalanche, a mass that has lost its\nequilibrium and falls, at first imperceptibly but with ever accelerating\nmovement down to the depths and lowest levels of the valley. This is the\nsecret of every degeneration and revolution. The European had first slain the\nhierarchy in himself by extirpating his own inner possibilities, to which\ncorresponded the basis of the order that he would then destroy\nexternally.\\n\\nIf Christian mythology attributes the Fall of Man and the\nRebellion of the Angels to the freedom of the will, then it comes to much the\nsame significance. It concerns the frightening potential that dwells in man of\nusing freedom to destroy spiritually and to banish everything that could\nensure him a supra-natural value. This is a metaphysical decision: the stream\nthat traverses history in the most varied forms of the traditional-hating,\nrevolutionary, individualistic, and humanistic spirit, or in short, the\n"modern" spirit. This decision is the only positive and decisive cause in the\nsecret of degeneration, the destruction of Tradition.\\n\\nIf we understand\nthis, we can perhaps also grasp the sense of those legends that speak of\nmysterious rulers who "always" exist and have never died (shades of the\nEmperor sleeping beneath the Kyffh\\xc3\\xa4user mountain!). Such rulers can be\nrediscovered only when one achieves spiritual completeness and awakens a\nquality in oneself like that of a metal that suddenly feels "the magnet",\nfinds the magnet and irresistibly orients itself and moves towards it. For\nnow, we must restrict ourselves to this hint. A comprehensive explanation of\nlegends of that sort, which come to us from the most ancient Aryan source,\nwould take us too far. At another opportunity we will perhaps return to the\nsecret of reconstruction, to the "magic" that is capable of restoring the\nfallen mass to the unalterable, lonely, and invisible peaks that are still\nthere in the\nheights.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/1404/degeneration.html\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfAgainst the Neo-Pagans\\nExtract from "Grundrisse" (1942) by\nJulius Evola\\n\\nThe Misunderstandings of the New "Paganism"\\n\\nIt is perhaps\nappropriate to point out the misunderstandings that are current at the moment\nin some radical circles, who believe that a solution lies in the direction of\na new paganism. This misunderstanding is already visible in the use of terms\nsuch as "pagan" and "pagandom". I myself, having used these expressions as\nslogans in a book that was published in Italy in 1928, and in Germany in 1934,\nhave cause for sincere regrets.\\n\\nCertainly the word for pagan or heathen,\npaganus, appears in some ancient Latin writers such as Livy without an\nespecially negative tone. But this does not alter the fact that with the\narrival of the new faith, the word paganus became a decidedly disparaging\nexpression, as used in early Christian apologetics. It derives from pagus,\nmeaning a small town or village, so that paganus refers to the peasant way of\nthinking: an uncultured, primitive, and superstitious way. In order to promote\nand glorify the new faith, the apologists had the bad habit of elevating\nthemselves through the denigration of other faiths. There was often a\nconscious and often systematic disparagement and misrepresentation of almost\nall the earlier traditions, doctrines, and religions, which were grouped under\nthe contemptuous blanket-term of paganism or heathendom. To this end, the\napologists obviously made a premeditated effort to highlight those aspects of\nthe pre-Christian religions and traditions that lacked any normal or\nprimordial character, but were clearly forms that had fallen into decay. Such\na polemical procedure lead, in particular, to the characterization of whatever\nhad preceded Christendom, and was hence non-Christian, as necessarily anti-\nChristian.\\n\\nOne should consider, then, that "paganism" is a fundamentally\ntendentious and artificial concept that scarcely corresponds to the historical\nreality of what the pre-Christian world always was in its normal\nmanifestations, apart from a few decadent elements and aspects that derived\nfrom the degenerate remains of older cultures.\\n\\nOnce we are clear about\nthis, we come today to a paradoxical realization: that this imaginary paganism\nthat never existed, but was invented by Christian apologists, is now serving\nas the starting-point for certain so-called pagan circles, and is thus\nthreatening for the first time in history to become a reality--no more and no\nless than that.\\n\\nWhat are the main traits of today\\\'s pagan outlook, as its\nown apologists believe and declare them to be? The primary one is the\nimprisonment in Nature. All transcendence is totally unknown to the pagan view\nof life: it remains stuck in a mixture of Spirit and Nature, in an ambiguous\nunity of Body and Soul. There is nothing to its religion but a superstitious\ndeification of natural phenomena, or of tribal energies promoted to the status\nof minor gods. Out of this there arises first of all a blood- and soil-bound\nparticularism. Next comes a rejection of the values of personality and\nfreedom, and a condition of innocence that is merely that of the natural man,\nas yet unawakened to any truly supra-natural calling. Beyond this innocence\nthere is only lack of inhibition, "sin," and the pleasure of sinning. In other\ndomains there is nothing but superstition, or a purely profane culture of\nmaterialism and fatalism. It is as though only the arrival of Christianity\n(ignoring certain precursors which are dismissed as insignificant) allowed the\nworld of supra-natural freedom to break through, letting in grace and\npersonality, in contrast to the fatalistic and nature-bound beliefs ascribed\nto "paganism," bringing with it a catholic ideal (in the etymological sense of\nuniversality) and a healthy dualism, which made it possible to subjugate\nNature to a higher law, and for the "Spirit" to triumph over the law of flesh,\nblood, and the false gods.\\n\\nThese are the main traits of the dominant\nunderstanding of paganism, i.e., of everything that does not entail a\nspecifically Christian world-view. Anyone who possesses any direct\nacquaintance with cultural and religious history, however elementary, can see\nhow incorrect and one-sided this attitude is. Besides, in the early Church\nFathers there are often signs of a higher understanding of the symbols,\ndoctrines, and religions of preceding cultures. Here we will give only a\nsampling.\\n\\nWhat most distinguished the pre-Christian world, in all its\nnormal forms, was not the superstitious divinization of nature, but a symbolic\nunderstanding of it, by virtue of which (as I have often emphasized) every\nphenomenon and every event appeared as the sensible revelation of a supra-\nsensible world. The pagan understanding of the world and of man was\nessentially marked by sacred symbolism.\\n\\nMoreover, the pagan way of life was\nabsolutely not that of a mindless innocence, nor a natural abandonment to the\npassions, even if certain forms of it were obviously degenerate. It was\nalready aware of a healthy dualism, which is reflected in its universal\nreligious or metaphysical conceptions. Here we can mention the dualistic\nwarrior-religion of the ancient Iranian Aryans, already discussed and familiar\nto all; the Hellenistic antithesis between the "two natures," between World\nand Underworld, or the Nordic one between the race of the Ases and the\nelementary beings; and lastly the Indo-Aryan contrast between sams\\\'ra, the\n"stream of forms," and m(o)kthi, "liberation" and "perfection."\\n\\nOn this\nbasis, all the great pre-Christian cultures shared the striving for a supra-\nnatural freedom, i.e., for the metaphysical perfection of the personality, and\nthey all acknowledged Mysteries and initiations. I have already pointed out\nthat the Mysteries often signified the reconquest of the primordial state, the\nspirituality of the solar, Hyperborean races, on the foundation of a tradition\nand a knowledge that were concealed through secrecy and exclusivity from the\npollutions of an environment already in decay. We have also seen that in the\nEastern lands, the Aryan quality was already associated with a "second birth"\nachieved through initiation. As for natural innocence as the pagan cult of the\nbody, that is a fairy-tale and not even in evidence among savages, for despite\nthe inner lack of differentiation already mentioned in connection with races\n"close to nature," these people inhibit and constrict their lives though\ncountless taboos in a way that is often stricter than the morality of the so-\ncalled "positive religions." And as for that which seems to the superficial\nview to embody the prototype of such "innocence," namely the classical ideal,\nthat was no cult of the body: it did not belong on that side of the body-\nspirit duality, but on the other side. As alreay stated, the classic ideal is\nthat of a Spirit that is so dominant that under certain favorable spiritual\nconditions it molds Body and Soul to its own image, and thereby achieves a\nperfect harmony between the inner and the outer.\\n\\nLastly, there is an\naspiration away from particularism to be found everywhere in the "pagan"\nworld, to which was due the imperial summons that marked the ascending phase\nof the Nordic-derived races. Such a summons was often metaphysically enhanced\nand refined, and appeared as the natural consequence of the expansion of the\nancient sacred state-concept; also as the form in which the victorious\npresence of the "higher world" and the paternal, Olympian principle sought to\nmanifest itself in the world of becoming. In this respect we might recall the\nold Iranian concept of Empire and of the "King of kings," with its associated\ndoctrine of the hvaren\\xc3\\x99 (the "celestial glory" with which the Aryan\nrulers were endowed), and the Indo-Aryan tradition of the "World-king" or\ncakravart\\xc3\\x93, etc., right up to the reappearance of these signifiers in\nthe "Olympian" assumptions of the ancient Roman idea of State and Empire. The\nRoman Empire, too, had its sacred contents, which were systematically\nmisunderstood or undervalued not only by Christendom, but also by the writers\nof "positive" history. Even the Emperor-cult had the sense of a hierarchical\nunity at the top of a pantheon, which was a series of separate territorial and\nancestral cults belonging to the non-Roman peoples, which were freely\nrespected so long as they kept within their normal boundaries. Finally,\nconcerning the "pagan" unity of the two powers, spiritual and temporal, this\nwas very far from meaning that they were fused As a "solar" race understood\nit, it expressed the superior rights that must accrue to the spiritual\nauthority at the center of any normal state; thus it was something quite\ndifferent from the emancipation and "supremacy" of a merely secular state. If\nwe were to make similar amendments in the spirit of true objectivity, the\npossibilities would be overwhelming.\\n\\nFurther Misunderstandings Concerning\nthe "Pagan" World-View\\n\\nThis having been said, there remains the real\npossibility of transcending certain aspects of Christianity. But one must be\nquite clear: the Latin term "transcendere" means literally leaving something\nbehind as one rises upwards, and not downwards! It is worth repeating that the\nprincipal thing is not the rejection of Christianity: it is not a matter of\nshowing the same incomprehension towards it as Christianity itself has shown,\nand largely continues to show, towards ancient paganism. It would rather be a\nmatter of completing Christianity by means of a higher and an older heritage,\neliminating some of its aspects and emphasizing other, more important ones, in\nwhich this faith does not necessarily contradict the universal concepts of\npre-Christian spirituality.\\n\\nThis, alas, is not the path taken by the\nradical circles we have mentioned. Many of these neo-pagans seem to have\nfallen into a trap deliberately set for them, often ending up by advocating\nand defending ideas that more or less correspond to that invented, nature-\nbound, particularistic pagandom, lacking light and transcendence, which was\nthe polemical creation of a Christian misunderstanding of the pre-Christian\nworld, and which is based, at most, on a few scattered elements of that world\nin its decline and devolution. And as if this were not enough, people often\nresort to an anti-Catholic polemic which, whatever its political\njustification, often drags out and adapts the old clich\\xc3\\x88s of a purely\nmodern, rationalist and enlightenment type that have been well-used by\nLiberalism, Democracy, and Freemasonry. This was also the case, to a degree,\nwith H. S. Chamberlain, and it appears again in a certain Italian movement\nthat has been trying to connect racial thinking with the "idealistic" doctrine\nof immanence.\\n\\nThere is a general and unmistakable tendency in neo-paganism\nto create a new, superstitious mysticism, based on the glorification of\nimmanence, of Life and Nature, which is in the sharpest contrast to that\nOlympian and heroic ideal of the great Aryan cultures of pre-Christian\nantiquity. It would indicate much more a turning towards the materialistic,\nmaternal, and telluric side, if it did not exhaust itself in foggy and\ndilettantish philosophizing. To give an example, we might ask what exactly is\nmeant by this "Nature," on which these groups are so keen? It is little use to\npoint out that it is certainly not the Nature that was experienced and\nrecognized by ancient, traditional man, but a rational construct of the French\nEncyclopedist period. It was the Encyclopedists who, with definitely\nsubversive and revolutionary motives, made up the myth of Nature as "good,"\nwise, and wholesome, in opposition to the rottenness of every human "Culture."\nThus we can see that the optimistic nature-myth of Rousseau and the\nEncyclopedists marches in the same ranks as "natural right," universalism,\nliberalism, humanitarianism, and the denial of any positive and structured\nform of sovereignty. Moreover, the myth in question has absolutely no basis in\nnatural history. Every honest scientist knows that there is no room for\n"Nature" in the framework of his theories, which have as their object the\ndetermination of purely abstract equivalences and mathematical relationships.\nAs far as biological research and genetics are concerned, we can already see\nthe disequilibrium that would occur the moment one held certain laws to be\nfinal, when they only apply to a partial aspect of reality. What people call\n"Nature" today has nothing to do with what nature meant to the traditional,\nsolar man, or to the knowledge of it that was accessible to such a man thanks\nto his Olympian and regal position. There is no sign of this whatever in the\nadvocates of this new mysticism.\\n\\nMisunderstandings of more or less the same\nkind. arise regarding political thought. Paganism is here often used as the\nsynonym for a merely worldly and yet exclusive concept of sovereignty, which\nturns the relationships upside-down. We have already seen that in the ancient\nstates, the unity of the two powers meant something quite different. It\nprovided the basis for the spiritualization of politics, whereas neo-paganism\nresults in actually politicizing the spiritual, and thereby treading once\nagain the false path of the Gallicans and Jacobins. In contrast, the ancient\nconcept of State and Empire always showed a connection to the Olympian\nidea.\\n\\nWhat shall we think of the attitude that regards Jewry, Rome, the\nCatholic Church, Freemasonry, and Communism as more or less one and the same\nthing, just because their presuppositions differ from the plain thinking of\nthe Folk? The Folk\\\'s thinking along these lines threatens to lose itself in\nthe dark, where no differentiation is possible any more. It shows that it has\nlost the genuine feeling for the hierarchy of values, and that it cannot\nescape the crippling alternative of destructive internationalism and\nnationalistic particularism, whereas the traditional understanding of the\nEmpire is superior to both these concepts.\\n\\nTo restrict ourselves to a\nsingle example: Catholic dogmatism actually fulfils a useful preventive role\nby stopping worldly mysticism and suchlike eruptions from below from passing a\ncertain frontier; it makes a strong dam that protects the area where\ntranscendent knowledge and the genuinely supra-natural and non-human elements\nreign--or at least where they should reign. One may well criticize the way in\nwhich such transcendence and knowledge have been understood in Christianity,\nbut one cannot cross over to a "profane" criticism that seizes on some\npolemical weapon or other, fantasizes over the supposed Aryan nature of the\nimmanence-doctrine, of "natural religion," the cult of "life," etc., without\nreally losing one\\\'s level: in short, one does not thereby attain the world of\nprimordial beginnings, but that of the Counter-Tradition or the telluric and\nprimitive modes of being. This would in fact be the very best way of re-\nconverting those people with the best "pagan" talents to Catholicism!\\n\\nOne\nmust be wary of falling into the misunderstandings and errors that we have\nmentioned, which basically serve only to defend the common enemy. One must try\nto develop the capacity to place oneself at that level where didactic\nconfusion cannot reach, and where all dilettantism and arbitrary intellectual\nactivity are excluded; where one resists energetically every influence from\nconfused, passionate desires and from the aggressive pleasure in polemics;\nwhere, finally and fundamentally, nothing counts but the precise, strict,\nobjective knowledge of the spirit of the Primordial\nTradition.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/1404/pagan.html\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfHitler and the Secret Societies\\nBy Julius Evola (from Il\nConciliatore, no. 10, 1971; translated from the German edition in Deutsche\nStimme, no. 8, 1998)\\n\\nIt is remarkable that some authors in France have\nresearched the relationship of German National Socialism to secret societies\nand initiatic organizations. The motivation for this was the supposed occult\nbackground of the Hitler movement. This thesis was first proposed in the well-\nknown and very far-fetched book by Pauwels and Bergier, "Le Matin des\nMagiciens" (English ed., "The Dawn of Magic"), in which National Socialism was\ndefined as the union of "magical thinking" with technology. The expression\nused for this was "Tank divisions plus Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Gu\\xc3\\xa9non": a phrase\nthat might well have caused that eminent representative of traditional thought\nand esoteric disciplines to turn indignantly in his grave.\\n\\nThe first\nmisunderstanding here is the confusion of the magical element with the\nmythical, whereas the two have nothing to do with one another. The role of\nmyths in National Socialism is undeniable, for example in the idea of the\nReich, the charismatic F\\xc3\\xbchrer, Race, Blood, etc. But rather than\ncalling these "myths," one should apply to them Sorel\\\'s concept of\n"motivating energy-ideas" (which is what all the suggestive ideas used by\ndemagogues commonly are), and not attribute to them any magical ingredient.\nSimilarly, no rational person thinks of magic in connection with the myths of\nFascism, such as the myth of Rome or that of the Duce, any more than with\nthose of the French Revolution or Communism. The investigation would proceed\ndifferently if one went on the assumption that certain movements, without\nknowing it, were subject to influences that were not merely human. But this is\nnot the case with the French authors. They are not thinking of influences of\nthat kind, but of a concrete nature, exercised by organizations that really\nexisted, among which were some that to various degrees were "secret."\nLikewise, some have spoken of "unknown superiors" who are supposed to have\ncalled forth the National Socialist movement and to have used Hitler as a\nmedium, though it is unclear what goals they could have had in mind in so\ndoing. If one considers the results, the catastrophic consequences to which\nNational Socialism led, even indirectly, those goals must have been obscure\nand destructive. One would have to identify the "occult side" of this movement\nwith what Gu\\xc3\\xa9non called the "Counter-Initiation." But the French\nauthors have also proposed the thesis that Hitler the "medium" emancipated\nhimself at a certain point from the "unknown superiors," almost like a Golem,\nand that the movement then pursued its fatal direction. But in that case one\nmust admit that these "unknown superiors" can have had no prescience and very\nlimited power, to have been incapable of putting a stop to their supposed\nmedium, Hitler.\\n\\nA lot of fantasy has been woven on the concrete level about\nthe origin of National Socialism\\\'s themes and symbols. Reference has been\nmade to certain organizations as forerunners, but ones to which it is very\ndifficult to attribute any genuine and factual initiatic character. There is\nno doubt that Hitler did not invent German racial doctrine, the symbol of the\nswastika, or Aryan antisemitism: all of these had long existed in Germany. A\nbook entitled "Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab" [The man who gave Hitler\nhis ideas] reports on J\\xc3\\xb6rg Lanz von Liebenfels (the title of nobility\nwas self-bestowed), who had formerly been a Cistercian monk and had founded an\nOrder that already used the swastika; Lanz edited the periodical "Ostara" from\n1905 onwards, which Hitler certainly knew, in which the Aryan and antisemitic\nracial theories were already clearly worked out.\\n\\nBut much more important\nfor the "occult background" of National Socialism is the role of the Thule\nSociety. Things are more complex here. This society grew out of the\nGermanenorden, founded in 1912, and was led by Rudolf von Sebottendorf, who\nhad been in the East and had published a strange booklet on "Die Praxis der\nalten t\\xc3\\xbcrkischen Freimaurerei" [The practice of ancient Turkish\nFreemasonry]. Practices were described therein that involved the repetition of\nsyllables, gestures, and steps, whose goal was the initiatic transformation of\nman, such as alchemy had also aimed at. It is unclear what Turkish masonic\norganization Sebottendorf was in contact with, and also whether he himself\npracticed the things in question, or merely described them.\\n\\nMoreover, it\ncannot be established whether these practices were employed in the Thule\nSociety that Sebottendorf headed. It would be very important to know that,\nbecause many top-ranking National Socialist personalities, from Hitler to\nRudolf Hess, frequented this society. In a way, Hitler was already introduced\nto the world of ideas of the Thule Society by Hess during their imprisonment\ntogether after the failed Munich Putsch.\\n\\nAt all events, it must be\nemphasized that the Thule Society was less an initiatic organization than it\nwas a secret society, which already bore the swastika and was marked by a\ndecided antisemitism and by Germanic racial thinking. One should be cautious\nabout the thesis that the name Thule is a serious and conscious reference to a\nNordic, Polar connection, in the effort to make a connection with the\nHyperborean origins of the Indo-Germans--since Thule appears in ancient\ntradition as the sacred center or sacred island in the uttermost North. Thule\nmay just be a play on the name "Thale," a location in the Harz where the\nGermanenorden held a conference in 1914, at which it was decided to create a\nsecret "v\\xc3\\xb6lkisch" band to combat the supposed Jewish International.\nAbove all, these ideas were emphasized by Sebottendorf in his book "Bevor\nHitler kam" [Before Hitler came], published in Munich in 1933, in which he\nindicated the myths and the "v\\xc3\\xb6lkisch" world-view that existed before\nHitler.\\n\\nThus a serious investigation into Hitler\\\'s initiatic connections\nwith secret societies does not lead far. A few explanations are necessary in\nregard to Hitler as a "medium" and his attractive power. It seems to us pure\nfantasy that he owed this power to initiatic practices. Otherwise one would\nhave to assume the same about the psychic power of other leaders, like\nMussolini and Napoleon, which is absurd. It is much better to go on the\nassumption that there is a psychic vortex that arises from mass movements, and\nthat this concentrates on the man in the center and lends him a certain\nradiation that is felt especially by suggestible people.\\n\\nThe quality of\nmedium (which, to put it bluntly, is the antithesis of an initiatic\nqualification) can be attributed to Hitler with a few reservations, because in\na certain respect he did appear as one possessed (which differentiates him\nfrom Mussolini, for example). When he whipped up the masses to fanaticism, one\nhad the impression that another force was directing him as a medium, even\nthough he was a man of a very extraordinary kind, and extremely gifted. Anyone\nwho has heard Hitler\\\'s addresses to the enraptured masses can have no other\nimpression. Since we have already expressed our reservations about the\nassumption that "unknown superiors" were involved, it is not easy to define\nthe nature of this supra-personal force. In respect to National Socialist\ntheosophy [Gotteserkenntnis], i.e. to its supposed mystical and metaphysical\ndimension, one must realize the unique juxtaposition in this movement and in\nthe Third Reich of mythical, Enlightenment, and even scientific aspects. In\nHitler, one can find many symptoms of a typically "modern" world-view that was\nfundamentally profane, naturalistic, and materialistic; while on the other\nhand he believed in Providence, whose tool he believed himself to be,\nespecially in regard to the destiny of the German nation. (For example, he saw\na sign of Providence in his survival of the assassination attempt in his East-\nPrussian headquarters.) Alfred Rosenberg, the ideologist of the movement,\nproclaimed the myth of Blood, in which he spoke of the "mystery" of Nordic\nblood and attributed to it a sacramental value; yet he simultaneously attacked\nall the rites and sacraments of Catholicism as delusions, just like a man of\nthe Enlightenment. He railed against the "Dark men of our time," while\nattributing to Aryan man the merit of having created modern science. National\nSocialism\\\'s concern with runes, the ancient Nordic-Germanic letter-signs,\nmust be regarded as purely symbolic, rather like the Fascist use of certain\nRoman symbols, and without any esoteric significance. The program of National\nSocialism to create a higher man has something of "biological mysticism" about\nit, but this again was a scientific project. At best, it might have been a\nquestion of the "superman" in Nietzsche\\\'s sense, but never of a higher man in\nthe initiatic sense.\\n\\nThe plan to "create a new racial, religious, and\nmilitary Order of initiates, assembled around a divinized F\\xc3\\xbchrer,"\ncannot be regarded as the official policy of National Socialism, as\nRen\\xc3\\xa9 Alleau writes, when he presents such a relationship and even\ncompares it, among others, to the Ishmaelites of Islam. A few elements of a\nhigher level were visible only in the ranks of the SS.\\n\\nIn the first place,\none can see clearly the intention of Reichsf\\xc3\\xbchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler\nto create an Order in which elements of Prussian ethics were to be combined\nwith those of the old Orders of knighthood, especially the Teutonic Order. He\nwas looking for legitimation of such an organization, but could not obtain it,\nsince these old Orders of Catholicism were openly opposed by the radical wing\nof National Socialism. Himmler was also seeking, without the possibility of\nany traditional connection, a relationship to the Nordic-Hyperborean heritage\nand its symbolism (Thule), albeit without those "secret societies" discussed\nabove having any influence over it. He took notice, as did Rosenberg, of the\nresearches of the Netherlander Herman Wirth into the Nordic-Atlantic\ntradition. Later Himmler founded, with Wirth, the research and teaching\norganization called the "Ahnenerbe." This is not without interest, but there\nwas no "occult background" to it.\\n\\nSo the net result is negative. The French\nauthors\\\' fantasy reaches its high point in the book "Hitler et la tradition\ncathare" by Jean-Michel Angebert (Paris, 1971). This deals with the Cathars,\nalso called Albigensians, who were a heretical sect that spread especially in\nSouthern France between the 11th and 12th centuries, and had their center in\nthe fortress of Monts\\xc3\\xa9gur. According to Otto Rahn, this was destroyed\nin a "crusade against the Grail," which is the title of one of his books.\nWhatever the Grail and its Grail-Knights had to do with this sect remains\ncompletely in the dark. The sect was marked by a kind of fanatical Manicheism:\nsometimes its own believers would die of hunger or some other cause as a\ndemonstration of their detachment from the world and their hostility to\nearthly existence in flesh and matter. Now it is assumed that Rahn, with whom\nwe corresponded during his lifetime and tried to persuade of the baselessness\nof his thesis, was an SS man, and that an expedition was sent on its way to\nretrieve the legendary Grail which was supposedly brought to safety at the\nmoment when the Cathars\\\' fortress in Monts\\xc3\\xa9gur was destroyed. After\nthe fall of Berlin, a unit is said to have reached the Zillertal and hidden\nthis object at the foot of a glacier, to await a new age.\\n\\nThe truth is that\nthere was talk of a commando unit, which however had a less mystical\ncommission, namely the rescue and concealment of the Reich\\\'s treasures. Two\nfurther examples show what such fantasies can lead to when they are given free\nrein. The SS (which included not only battle units but also researchers and\nscholarly experts) mounted an expedition to Tibet in order to make discoveries\nin the fields of alpinism and ethnology, and another one to the Arctic,\nostensibly for scientific research but also with a view to the possible\nsituation of a German military base. According to these fantastic\ninterpretations, the first expedition was seeking a link to a secret center of\nthe Tradition, while the other was seeking contact with the lost Hyperborean\nThule...\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/1404/hitlerengl.html\'\n\n'b'b"\\xef\\xbb\\xbfUnited Europe: The Spiritual Prerequisite \\n\\nThe first\npolitical step in forging a united Europe would be the withdrawal of all\nEuropean governments from the United Nations, a hypocritical organisation if\nthere ever was.\\n\\nThe ground for a European initiative must be carefully\nprepared; but the problems of concrete political tactics fall outside the\nscope of this essay. Here we can only point to what we believe must be the\nform and the spiritual and doctrinal basis of united Europe.\\n\\n\'Federalist\'\nand \'associative\' solutions, economic and military co-operation\\xe2\\x80\\x94\nthese are all the manifestation of presuppositions about the organic character\nof Europe (or the lack of it). The condition of a truly European entity must\nbe the binding force of an idea and tradition with which Europe is irrevocably\nlinked. Some argue that the nation state, being not divinely ordained but the\ncreation of determined groups successfully rising to a historical challenge,\nis a model for the merging European nation. According to this view the\nspiritual precondition for a united Europe exists in the myth of a common\ndestiny defended by the \'national revolutionary\' groups of Europe. This view\nis inadequate. The birth of the European nations was largely the work of\ndynasties representing a tradition of loyalty to a particular crown. In any\ncase, the factors which created the European nations have been the very ones\nwhich have maintained European disunity from the Hundred Years War to the\npresent day.\\n\\nAmong those who possess a spiritual and traditional\nunderstanding of Europe we can distinguish between those who believe in an\nImperium of the kind referred to above, and those who talk of Europe as a\nnation. The concept of nationhood is in my opinion inappropriate. The notion\nof European unity is spiritual and supranational. Homeland nation, ethnic\ngroup subsist at an essentially naturalistic \'physical\' level. Europe (Europa\nuna) should be something more than this. The old nationalisms and resentments\nare only grafted onto Europe when a particular national domination is imposed\nby one nation upon the rest of Europe. The European Imperium will belong to a\nhigher order than the parts which compose it, and to be European should be\nconceived as being something qualitatively different from being Italian,\nPrussian, Basque, Finnish, Scottish or Hungarian, something which appeals to a\ndifferent aspect of our character. A European nation implies the levelling and\ncancelling of all \'rival\' nations in or beyond Europe.\\n\\nSo far as \'European\nculture\' is concerned it is these days the stamping-ground of the pragmatic\nEuropean, the liberal, humanist intellectual. His \'European culture\' is an\nappendage of \'democracy\' and the \'Free World\'. In this sense \'culture\' is the\nstock-in-trade of the so-called \'aristocrat of thought\', in reality the\nclothing of the parvenu, his badge of success. A genuine aristocracy of the\nintellect would not in any case be adequate for the task in hand; the re-\nanimation of the European will and the sustaining of a revolutionary elite who\ncould make this a political possibility. What is more, every time that we try\nto give the notion of \'European culture\' concrete significance, we seem to run\nup against innumerable \'interpretations\' which leave us with nothing\nconclusive at all. Everyone has their own idea about what European culture is\nand many Europeans feel reticent or even guilty about championing it and so\nthe parvenus can speculate to their hearts\' content in the reviews and colour\nsupplements about all the latest developments in this or that field of art in\nsuch a way that \'culture\' becomes entirely divorced from the \'serious world\',\nfrom what matters. Ironically, much of what the defenders of culture admire\nplays a major role in helping to bring about a spiritual crisis and lack of\nconfidence in European culture.\\n\\nThe \'Westernisation\' of the world has meant\nthat this decomposition extends across the world\\xe2\\x80\\x94thus Europe, from\nilluminism to communism has become the breeding ground of the very forces\nwhich work to destroy everything which is specifically European.\\n\\nWe must\ncreate a \'unity of fighters\'. That is a pre-requisite. To set a vision of the\nworld and of Europe aside as \'irrelevant\' would be to sink into the morass of\npolitical partisan politics, a cynical affair without identity, without\nspiritual meaning. A united Europe, without a communal spiritual identity and\nsense of direction would become just one more power bloc. In what way would\nsuch a United States of Europe be spiritually distinct from the United States\nof America or China or be anything nobler than the organisation of African\nUnity? Europe must not be a stage towards the Westernisation of the world but\na move against it, in fact a revolt against the modern world in favour of what\nis nobler, higher, more truly\nhuman.\\n\\nhttp://www.oswaldmosley.com/people/evola.html"\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfFascism as Anti-Europe\\n\\n\\nCan fascism be the source of an\nanti-European restoration?\\n\\nIs fascism powerful enough today to take on such\na task?\\n\\nFascism arose from below, from confused needs and brutal forces\nunleashed by the European war. Fascism has thrived on compromises, on\nrhetoric, on the petty ambitions of petty people. The state organization that\nit has created is often uncertain, awkward, inexpert, violent, cramped,\nriddled by ambiguities.\\n\\nNevertheless, if we look around us today and note\nthe demise of the only two states - Russia and Germany - that had preserved\nremnants of hierarchical values (however distorted and materialized) we must\ndraw the conclusion that fascism is the West\\\'s best hope.\\n\\nFor better or\nworse, fascism has developed a body. But this body is still lacking a soul. It\nis still lacking the superior power (atto) needed to justify it, complete it,\nmake it rise to its feet as a principle opposed to all of Europe. The soul in\nquestion can achieve these ends only if fascism manages to resurrect a\ndistinctive system of meta-economics and metapolitical values by means of a\nradical, profound, absolute upheaval (rivolgimento), a new leap ahead and away\nfrom the politics of "normalisation" and bourgeois compromise\n(imborghesimento) that is beginning to pervade contemporary fascism.\\n\\nBut\nlet\\\'s not misunderstand one another.\\n\\nThe breeding ground of fascism were\nyouthful, resolute forces, ready for anything, immune to the evils of\n"culture". To this day they represent the vital nucleus of fascism, while\nthose who worry about developing a "philosophy of fascism" and a "fascist\nculture" are themselves symptoms of degeneration, or, at the very least, of a\nturn away from the path leading to something really new; a true revolution\n(not one regarding which one can conclude "plus ca change, plus c\\\'est la meme\nchose).\\n\\nNo. Fascism must remain antiphilosophical. Decisevely and crudely\nso. Tapping into its purest core of force, it must sweep away the filthy film\nof rhetoric, sentimentalism, moralism, and hypocritical piety with which the\nWest has clouded and humanized everything. There is an irrefutable need for\nsomeone to break into the temple - perhaps even a barbarian - to drive out the\ncorrupters of "civilized" Europe, the monopolistic preachers of the "spirit",\ngood and evil, and the divine who actually know only matter and what human\nwords, fear, and superstition have layered over matter.\\n\\nTo all this I reply\n"That\\\'s enough!". My negations is meant to allow a few men to rediscover the\nlong paths, the long danger, the long gaze, and the long silence, to unleash\nthe wind of the open sea - the wind of the MEDITERRANEAN TRADITION - so that\nit may revive the enslaved men of the West.\\n\\nJulius Evola, Revolt against\nthe modern world Antiphilosophy, antisentiment, antireligion: these are the\npremises. No more aestheticisms and idealisms: not a single one! No more\nthirsting of the soul for a hallucinated God to pray to and adore. No more\nacceptance of the common ties and mutual interdependencies that bind beggars\ntogether on a foundation of lack.\\n\\nTo soar beyond and above with pure faces.\nForces that will have to meet a challenge that transcends politics and social\nconcerns, that recoils at the clamorous gesture and superficial resonance, a\nchallenge so great that the material forces vibrating out in the world of\npeople and things can no longer have any effect.\\n\\nIn silence, under\nconditions of strict discipline, inflexible self-control, seriousness, and\nsimplicity, with the brisk and tenacious effort of individuals, we in Italy\nmust create an elite in whom Wisdom comes to life again. By "wisdom" I mean\nthe power (virtus) that does not allow itself to speak, that rises up out of a\nhermetic and Pythagorean silence, that comes into being by subduing the senses\nand the soul, and that manifests itself not by means of arguments and books\nbut through powerful actions.\\n\\nWe must reawaken to a renewed, spiritualized,\nbitter feeling (sensazione) for the world, not as a philosophical concept but\nas something that vibrates in the rhythm of our very blood: a feeling for the\nworld as power, as the agile and free rhythmic dance of Shiva, as a\nsacrificial act (Veda). This feeling will breed strong, hard, active, solar,\nMediterranean beings; beings made up of force and eventually only of force;\nbeings infused with a sense of freedom and nobility whose cosmic perspective\n(respiro cosmico) has been much stammered about but little understood by\nEurope\\\'s "dead". Science today is profane, democratic, and materialistic.\nAlways relative and qualified in its truths, a slave to phenomena and to\nincomprehensible laws, it remains mute with regard to the profound reality of\nman. To debunk it we must reawaken in the new elite a sacred science, a\nscience that is inferior and secret and gives rise to initiations, a science\nof self-fulfillment and self- dignification that taps the occult forces that\ngovern our being and subdues them so as to permit men to be actually (not\nmythically) reborn as beings superior to the laws of the body and of space and\ntime.\\n\\nSo a race of leaders it will be. Invisible leaders who do not rattle\non or parade about but who act irresistibly and are capable of anything. A\ncenter will thus exist in decentered Europe.\\n\\nThe problem of hierarchy can\nonly be addressed by creating leaders, a strictly individual and internal\nproblem, resistant to external solutions. Hierarchy can come into being only\nwhen there are leaders and not vice versa.\\n\\nThe empire cannot be built on\neconomic, military, industrial, and even "ideal" foundations. The imperium,\naccording to the Iranian and Roman conception, is transcendent. It can only be\nattained by those who have the power to trascend the petty lives of petty men\nand their petty appetites, patriostisms, "values", "nonvalues", and\ngods.\\n\\nThe ancients understood this when they deified their emperors,\njoining together royal dignity and spiritual dignity. Have the young\nbarbarians who have dared to resurrect the eagle and the fasces learned this\nlesson? Have they understood that there is no alternative, that this is the\nonly way to transform their "revolution" into the first light that pierces the\nthick fog of European decadence? Rather than amounting to little more than the\nsmall contigency of a small nation, they could plant the seed for a resurgence\nof Rome throughout the world, the seed for a true restoration.\\n\\n\\nJulius\nEvola\\n\\n\\nTranslation from Imperialismo Pagano, Atanor, Todi-Roma\n1928.\\n\\nhttp://www.centrostudilaruna.it/evolafascismantieu.html\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfJulius Evola and Russian Traditionalism\\n\\nBy Alexandre\nDouguine\\n\\n1) The Discovery of Evola in Russia\\n\\nJulius Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\nworks were discovered in the 1960s by the very esoteric group of anti-\ncommunist intellectual thinkers known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe dissidents of the\nright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They were a small circle of people who had conscientiously\nrefused to participate in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the\nUSSR and who had instead chosen an underground existence for themselves. The\ndisparity between the presented Soviet culture and the actual Soviet reality\nwas almost entirely what made them seek out the fundamental principles that\ncould explain the origins of that evil, absolutist idea. It was through their\nrefusal of communism that they discovered certain works by anti-modernist and\ntraditionalist authors: above all, the books by Rene Guenon and by Julius\nEvola. Two central personalities animated this group \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Islamic\nphilosopher Geidar Djemal and the nonconformist poet Eugene Golovine. Thanks\nto them, these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdissidents of the right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d knew the names\nand the ideas of the two greatest traditionalists of our century. In the\n1970s, one of the first translations of an Evola work (The Hermetic Tradition)\nappeared and it was distributed within the group according to the methods of\nSamizdat [note: Samizdat was the system in the former USSR through which\nofficially \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpermissible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d books made their way around\nthe country; generally these were copies of copies and not well-produced, but\nthey tended to get their point across.]. However, the original translations\nwere particularly bad in quality because they were made by incompetent\namateurs far removed from the group of authentic intellectual\ntraditionalists.\\nIn 1981, a translation of Heidnische Imperialismus appeared\nin a similar manner as the only book of its type available from the Library of\nLenin in Moscow. This time around, the distribution through Samizdat had\nbecome much larger and the quality of the translation was much better. Little\nby little, they moved the true current of traditionalism away from anti-\ncommunism and towards anti-modernism by extending their complete refusal of\nSoviet existence to a rejection of the modern world, very much in accordance\nwith the integral traditionalist vision. It should be noted, though, that the\nideas of the traditionalists in question at this particular point in time were\nvery far-removed from the other \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdissidents of the\nright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who were generally orthodox Christians, monarchists, and\nnationalists. Evola, then, was more popular among those who were interested in\nspiritualism in a broader sense: yoga, theosophy [note: a\nreligious/philosophical school of thought founded by Russian occultist Helena\nBlavatsky], psychism [note: a theosophic concept relating to all mental\nphenomena; C.G. Jung discussed it occasionally as well], and so\nforth.\\nThroughout Perestroika, all forms of anticommunist dissidence\nmanifested themselves and from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdissidents of the\nright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the current political and cultural ideologies of the\nRight \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nationalist, nostalgic, anti-liberal, and anti-Western. In\nthis context and after the development of strict traditionalist ideas as a\nresult of Glasnost, the names of Guenon and Evola were introduced into\nRussia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cultural ensemble. The first works of Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\nappeared in the 1990s in widely-read parts of the press known to be\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpatriotic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\nthe subject of traditionalism became the theme among virulent polemics and was\na very big issue in the Russian Right as a whole. Papers like Elementy, Nach\nSovremennik, Mily Anguel, Den, etc., began to publish fragments of\nEvola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writings or articles inspired by him or ones in which his\nname and quotes were referenced. Little by little, the\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp came to have an ideological\nstructure that produced a separation between the old, nostalgic, monarchist\nRight and the other more open, non-conformist, and less-orthodox Right\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 sometimes referred to as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovye pravye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nin Russian, one may be inclined to draw parallels to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnouvelle\ndroite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it was a quite separate and altogether different\nphenomenon from the European ND. One could categorize this second group of\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpatriots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as being part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThird\nWay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnational revolutionaries\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so\nforth. The breaking point came exactly over the acceptance or rejection of\nEvola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas or perhaps more appropriately over parts of\nEvola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas that could not be considered\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9creactionary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\nnature, as in the idea of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConservative Revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nand the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRevolt Against the Modern World.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRecently,\nthe first book \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Heidnische Imperialismus \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had 50,000\ncopies published. A television show devoted to Evola has even been made for a\npopular channel. Thus, one can see that Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discovery of Evola\nhas taken place on a rather broad scale. He who once constituted the\nhypermarginal intellectual nucleus of Russia before Perestroika has now become\na significant political and ideological phenomenon. But it is clear that Evola\nwrote his books and formulated his ideas in a very different temporal,\ncultural, historical, and ethnic context. This, therefore, poses a problem:\nwhat parts of Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s philosophy are relevant to modern Russia and\nwhat parts need to be reworked, improved, or even rejected in these\ncircumstances? This requires a brief analysis comparing and contrasting the\nsacred traditionalism of Evola and the strictly Russian political\nphenomenon.\\n\\n2) Against the Modern West\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, it is\nobvious that the rejection of the profane and venal modern world that\nmanifested itself in Western Civilization in the last few centuries is common\nto both Evola and the entirety of the intellectual tradition of Russian\nslavophilia. Russian authors like Homyakov, Kirievsky, Aksakov, Leontiev, and\nDanilevsky among philosophers as well as Dostoevsky, Gogol, and Merejkovsky\namong novelists criticized the Western world in almost the exact same language\nas did Evola. One can see that they all had the same hate for the rule of the\nmob \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is to say, the modern democratic system \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\nthat they regarded it as spiritual degradation and total profanity. Similarly,\none can also see the same diagnoses for the sickness of the modern world\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 profane Freemasonry, deviant Judaism, the advancement of the\nplebeian, the deification of \\xe2\\x80\\x9creason\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in\nEvola and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Russian culture. Obviously,\nthe reactionary tendency here is shared, and thus Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criticism\nof the West is totally in-step with and acceptable to the party line of\nRussian conservatism.\\n\\nMore often than not, one can see that\nEvola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criticisms are more closely related to the Russian\nmentality rather than the broader European one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the same type of\ngeneralization, the frequent evocation of mythological and mystical goals, the\ndistinct notion that the internal spirit world is organically separated from\nthe immediate modern realities of perversion and deviance. In general, the\nRussian conservative tradition of contemporarily explaining historical events\nin a mythological sense is somewhat obligatory. The appeal of the\nsupernatural/irrational level here is in perfect step with the Russian mindset\nthat renders rational explanation the exception rather than the rule.\\n\\nOne\nmay also note the influence that Russian conservatives exercised on Evola: in\nhis works, he often cites Dostoevsky, Merejkovsky (whom he personally knew)\nand several other Russian authors. On the other hand, the frequent references\nhe makes to Malynsky and Leon de Poncins partially carry on the counter-\nrevolutionary tradition so typical of being European. One can also cite his\nreferences to Serge Nilus, the compiler of the famous Protocols of the Elders\nOf Zion, which Evola reedited in Italy.\\n\\nAt the same time, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\nclear that Evola knew relatively little about the Russian conservative milieu,\nand in fact he was not even particularly interested in it owing to his\nantichristian idiosyncrasy. A propos of the Orthodox tradition, he only made a\nfew insignificant comments. Yet the similarity between his position towards\nthe crisis of the modern world and the anti-modernism of the Russian authors\nis due largely to the community of organic reactions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Great Men\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x98individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the case of Evola and heroes in the\ncase of the Russians. But thanks to this spontaneity of anti-modern\nconvergences, the gravity of Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deviation is made all the more\ninteresting and all the more critical.\\n\\nAt any rate, this interpretation of\nEvola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas fits perfectly within the framework of the modern\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovye pravye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ideology to the extent that the latter\nactually brings more to his vision of the degradation of modernity by\nsometimes applying his ideas more globally, more radically, and more deeply.\nIn this regard, Evola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theories are very much accepted in modern\nRussia, where anti-Westernism is an extremely potent ideological and political\nfactor.\\n\\n3) Rome and Third Rome\\n\\nOne particular layer of Evola\\\'s thoughts\nis felt by the Russians to be of imminent and extreme importance: his praise\nfor the Imperial Ideal. Rome represents the focal point of Evola\\\'s worldview.\nThis sacred living power which had manifested itself all across the Empire was\nto Evola the very essence of the West\\\'s traditional heritage. To Evola, the\nruins of Nero\\\'s palace and of Roman buildings were like a direct testament to\na physical, organic sanctity whose integrity and continuity had been shattered\nby the Kafkaesque "castle" of the Catholic Vatican Guelph. [NOTE: For those\nnot familiar with Kafka\\\'s work, this is a reference to his book entitled "the\nCastle," which is about a man who takes what should be a relatively simple job\nin a distant place surveying the land of a local noble, but who is unable to\nbegin -- much less complete -- his job owing to the opposition from the\nbureaucracy of his own employer (whom he never meets in-person and only\nthrough a proxy or a proxy of a proxy) and who is further frustrated by the\nfact that the Count\\\'s huge, oppressive castle is always visible from any part\nof the town but that he can never actually go there to begin his task.\nObviously this is a metaphorical indictment against the overall judeo-\nchristian system and how it relates to seemingly unattainable salvation.\nSimilarly, Guelph refers to a German/Italian coalition of the Middle Ages that\nsupported the royal house of Guelph against the Imperial German Ghibelline\ndynasty that was hostile to the Pope and to Catholicism.] His Ghibelline train\nof thought was clear: Imperium against Church, Rome against the Vatican, the\nimmenent and organic sacrality against the devotational and sentimental\nabstractions of faith, implicitly dualist and Phariseean.\\n\\nBut a similar\nline of thought is seemingly naturally felt by the Russians, whose historical\ndestiny has always been profoundly tied to that of Imperium. This notion was\ndogmatically rooted in the Orthodox Concept of staret [NOTE: the starets were\nspiritual advisers, but not priests: Rasputin could be considered one of\nthese] philosophy - "Moscow: the Third Rome." It should be noted that the\n"first Rome" in this cyclic orthodox interpretation was not Christian Rome,\nbut rather Imperial Rome, because the second Rome (or the "new Rome") was\nConstantinople, the capital of the Christian Empire. Thus the same idea of\n"Rome" held by the Orthodox Russians corresponds to the understanding of\nsacrality like the importance of that which is Sacred and such as the\nnecessary and inseparable \\xe2\\x80\\x9csymphony\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between the\nspiritual authority and the temporal realm. For traditional orthodoxy, the\ncatholic separation between the King and the Pope is simply unimaginable and\nclose to blasphemy, and this very concept is actually called the\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLatin heresy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAgain, one can see the perfect\nconvergence between Evola\\\'s dogma and the commonplace mindset of Russian\nconservative thought. And still again, the clear spiritual exaltation of\nImperium in Evola\\\'s books is of inestimable value to the Russians in terms of\nwhat they view as their true and traditional identity. The "symphonic\nimperialism" of the Orthodox Russians easily brings to mind Julius Evola\\\'s\nconcept of "pagan imperialism," or rather "Ghibelline imperialism."\\n\\nThere\nis one other important detail that bears mentioning here. It\\\'s known that the\n"author of the Third Reich," Artur M\\xc3\\xbcller van den Bruck, was deeply\ninfluenced by the writings of Feodor Dostoevsky, for whom the concept of "the\nThird Rome" was vitally significant. One can see van den Bruck\\\'s same\neschatological vision of "the Final Empire," born from a metaphorical\nconvergence between the ideas of the paracletic montanists [NOTE: montanists\nwere the ancient forerunners of the contemporary pentecostal sects, i.e., the\nones who believe in personal divine revelation and speaking in tongues] and\nthe prophecies of Joachim de Flora [NOTE: de Flora was the abbot of Corazzo\nwho authored a very prescient essay about the "age of reason" around the year\n1200 in which he wrote "in the new day, man would not have to rely on faith,\nfor everything would be founded on knowledge and reason."]. Van den Bruck --\nwhose ideas were sometimes cited by Evola -- adapted the concept of the Third\nRome from the Russian Orthodox tradition and applied it to Germany, where it\nwas subsequently elaborated upon spiritually and socially by the National\nSocialists. One interesting fact is that Erich Mueller, the proteg\\xc3\\xa9 of\nNikisch [NOTE: Ernst Nikisch, a German nationalist of the same era] -- who was\ngreatly inspired by van den Bruck -- once remarked that if the First Reich had\nbeen Catholic [NOTE: ie, the Holy Roman Empire], the Second Reich Protestant\n[NOTE: ie, Prussia under Friedrich the Great], the Third Reich would have to\nbe exactly Orthodox! But Evola himself participated largely in the\nintellectual debates of German conservative-revolutionary circles (he was a\nmember of von Gleichen\\\'s "Herrenklub," which itself was a continuation of the\n"Juniklub"founded by van den Bruck) where similary subjects were discussed in\na very lively manner. It\\\'s now easy to see another way in which the Russian\nconservative mindset is linked to Evola\\\'s theories. Obviously, it\\\'s not\npossible to say their ideas on these particular issues were identical, but at\nthe same time, there are extraordinary connections between the two that help\nto explain the assimilation of Evola\\\'s ideas into Russia\\\'s mindset, where\nits views are far less "extravagant" than those belonging of traditional\nconservative Europe, which is by and large contemporarily Catholic and\nNationalist, and is quite rarely\nImperialist.\\n\\nhttp://bbs.anus.com/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f;=9&amp;t;=000017\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfEuropean Decadence\\n\\n\\nPresent Western "civilization" awaits a\nsubstantial upheaval (rivolgimento), without which it is destined, sooner or\nlater, to smash its own head. It has carried out the most complete perversion\nof the rational order of things. Reign of matter, gold, machines, numbers; in\nthis civilization there is no longer breath or liberty or light. The West has\nlost its ability to command and to obey. It has lost its feeling for\ncontemplation and action. It has lost its feeling for values, spiritual power,\ngodlike men (uomini-idii). It no longer knows nature. No longer a living body\nmade of symbols, gods, and ritual act, no longer a harmony, a cosmos in which\nman moves freely like "a kingdom within a kingdom", nature has assumed for the\nWesterner a dull and fatal exteriority whose mystery the secular sciences seek\nto bury in trifling laws and hypotheses. It no longer knows Wisdom. It ignores\nthe majestic silence of those who have mastered themselves: the enlightened\ncalm of seers, the exalted reality of those in whom the idea becomes blood,\nlife, and power. Instead it is drowning in the rhetoric of "philosophy" and\n"culture", the speciality of professors, journalists, and sportsmen who issue\nplans, programs, and proclamations. Its wisdom has been polluted by a\nsentimental, religious, humanitarian contagion and by a race of frenzied men\nwho run around noisily celebrating becoming (divenire) and "practice", because\nsilence and contemplation alarm them.\\n\\nIt no longer knows the state, the\nstate as value (stato-valore) crystallized in the Empire. Synthesis of the\nsort of spirituality and majesty that shone brightly in Chinaa, Egypt, Persia,\nand Rome, the imperial ideal has been overwhelmed by the bourgeois misery of a\nmonopoly of slaves and traders.\\n\\nEurope\\\'s formidable "activists" no longer\nknow what war is, war desired in and of itself as a virtue higher than winning\nor losing, as that heroic and sacred path to spiritual fulfilment exalted by\nthe god Krishna in the Baghavad Gita. They know not warriors, only soldiers.\nAnd a crummy little war (guerricciola) was enough to terrorize them and drive\nthem to rehashing the rhetoric of humanitarianism, and pathos or, worse still,\nof windbag nationalism and Dannunzianism.\\n\\nJulius Evola, Revolt against the\nmodern world Europe has lost its simplicity, its central position, its life. A\ndemocratic plague is eating away at its roots, whether in law, science, or\nspeculation. Gone are the leaders, beings who stand out not for their\nviolence, their gold, or for their skills as slave traders but rather for\ntheir irreducible qualities of life. Europe is a great irrelevant body,\nsweating and restless because of an anxiety that no one dares to express. Gold\nflows in its veins; its flesh is made up of machines, factories, and laborers;\nits brains are of newsprint. A great irrelevant body tossing and turning,\ndriven by dark and unpredictable forces that mercilessly crush whoever wants\nto oppose or merely escape the cogwheels.\\n\\nSuch are the achievements of\nWestern "civilization". This is the much ballyhooed result of the\nsuperstitious faith in "progress", progress beyond Roman imperiousness, beyond\nradiant Hellas, beyond the ancient Orient - the great ocean.\\n\\nAnd the few\nwho are still capable of great loathing and great rebellion find themselves\never more tightly encircled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJulius Evola\\n\\n\\nTranslation from\nImperialismo pagano, Atanor, Todi-Roma 1928.\n\\n\\nhttp://www.centrostudilaruna.it/evolaeuropeandec.html\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbf"Our" American Media\\n\\n\\nJulius Evola, Revolt against the\nModern World Americanisation in Europe is widespread and evident. In Italy it\nis a phenomenon which is rapidly developing in these post-war years and is\nconsidered by most people, if not enthusiastically, at least as something\nnatural. Some time ago I wrote that of the two great dangers confronting\nEurope - Americanism and Communism - the first is the more insidious.\nCommunism cannot be a danger other than in the brutal and catastrophic form of\na direct seizure of power by communists. On the other hand Americanisation\ngains ground by a process of gradual infiltration, effecting modifications of\nmentalities and customs which seem inoffensive in themselves but which end in\na fundamental perversion and degradation against which it is impossible to\nfight other than within oneself.\\n\\nIt is precisely with respect to such\ninternal opposition that most Italians seem weak. Forgetting their own\ncultural inheritance they readily turn to the United States as something akin\nto the parent guide of the world. Whoever wants to be modern has to measure\nhimself according to the American standard. It is pitiable to witness a\nEuropean country so debase itself. Veneration for America has nothing to do\nwith a cultured interest in the way other people live. On the contrary,\nservility towards the United States leads one to think that there is no other\nway of life worth considering on the same level as the American one.\\n\\ncover\nOur radio service is Americanised. Without any criterion of superior and\ninferior it just follows the fashionable themes of the moment and markets what\nis considered \\\'acceptable\\\' - acceptable, that is, to the most Americanised\nsection of the public, which is to say the most degenerate. The rest of us are\ndragged along in its wake. Even the style of presentation on radio has become\nAmericanised. "Who, after listening to an American radio programme, can\nsuppress a shudder when he considers that the only way of escaping communism\nis by becoming Americanised?" Those are not the words of an outsider but of an\nAmerican sociologist, James Burnham, professor at the University of Princeton.\nSuch a judgement from an American should make Italian radio programmers blush\nfor shame.\\n\\nThe consequence of the \\\'do your own thing\\\' democracy is the\nintoxication of the greater part of the population which is not capable of\ndiscriminating for itself, which, when not guided by a power and an ideal, all\ntoo easily loses sense of its own identity.\\n\\n\\nJulius Evola\n\\n\\nhttp://www.centrostudilaruna.it/evolaouramericanmedia.html\'\n\n'b'b"\\xef\\xbb\\xbfAmerican Morality\\n\\n\\nJulius Evola, Eros and the Mysteries of\nLove: The Metaphysics of Sex The much-vaunted sex appeal of American women is\ndrawn from films, reviews and pin-ups, and is in large print fictitious. A\nrecent medical survey in the United States showed that 75 per cent of young\nAmerican women are without strong sexual feeling and instead of satisfying\ntheir libido they seek pleasure narcissistically in exhibitionism, vanity and\nthe cult of fitness and health in a sterile sense.\\n\\nAmerican girls have \'no\nhang-ups about sex\'; they are \'easy going\' for the man who sees the whole\nsexual process as something in isolation thereby making it uninteresting and\nmatter-of-fact, which, at such a level, it is meant to be. Thus, after she has\nbeen taken to the cinema or a dance, it is something like American good\nmanners for the girl to let herself be kissed - this doesn\'t mean anything.\nAmerican women are characteristically frigid and materialistic. The man who\n\'has his way\' with an American girl is under a material obligation to her. The\nwoman has granted a material favour. In cases of divorce American law\noverwhelmingly favours the woman. American women will divorce readily enough\nwhen they see a better bargain. It is frequently the case in America that a\nwoman will be married to one man but already \'engaged\' to a future husband,\nthe man she plans to marry after a profitable divorce.\\n\\n\\nJulius Evola\n\\n\\nhttp://www.centrostudilaruna.it/evolaamericanmorality.html\\n\\n"\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfOn the dark age\\n\\nfrom Revolt Against the Modern World by\nJulius Evola, 1896\\n\\nIn reference to what I previously said concerning what\nancient traditions called the Dark Age (Kali Yuga), I will now describe some\nof the features of this age found in an ancient Hindu text, the Visnu Purana.\nI will put in brackets what I consider to be the contemporary\napplications.\\n\\n Outcastes and barbarians will be masters of the banks of the\nIndus, Darvika, the Chandrabhaga and Kashmir.

This distinction originated from a\nsaying (hadith) of the Prophet, who on the way back from a military expedition\nsaid: "You have returned from a lesser holy war to a great holy war." The\ngreater holy war is of an inner and spiritual nature; the other is the\nmaterial war waged externally against an enemy population with the particular\nintent of bringing "infidel" populations under the rule of "God\\\'s Law" (al-\nIslam). The relationship between the "greater" and "lesser holy war", however,\nmirrors the relationship between the soul and the body; in order to understand\nthe heroic asceticism or "path of action", it is necessary to understand the\nsituation in which the two paths merge, the "lesser holy war" becoming the\nmeans through which a "greater holy war" is carried out, and vice versa: the\n"little holy war", or the external one, becomes almost a ritual action that\nexpresses and gives witness to the reality of the first. Originally, orthodox\nIslam conceived of a unitary form of asceticism: that which is connected to\nthe jihad or "holy war".\\n\\nThe "greater holy war" is man\\\'s struggle against\nthe enemies he carries within. More exactly, it is the struggle of man\\\'s\nhigher principle against everything that is merely human in him, against his\ninferior natur and against chaotic impulses and all sorts of material\nattachments. This is expressly outlined in a text of Aryan warrior wisdom:\n"Know Him therefore who is above reason; and let his peace give thee peace. Be\na warrior and kill desire, the powerful enemy of the soul." (Bhagavadgita\n3.43)\\n\\nThe "enemy" who resists us and the "infidel" within ourselves must be\nsubdued and put in chains. This enemy is the animalistic yearning and\ninstinct, the disorganized multiplicity of impulses, the limitations imposed\non us by a fictitious self, and thus also fear, wickedness, and uncertainty;\nthis subduing of the enemy within is the only way to achieve inner liberation\nor the rebirth in a state of deeper inner unity and "peace" in the esoteric\nand triumphal sense of the word.\\n\\nIn the world of traditional warrior\nasceticism the "lesser holy war", namely, the external war, is indicated and\neven prescribed as the means to wage this "greater holy war"; thus in Islam\nthe expressions "holy war" (jihad) and "Allah\\\'s way" are often used\ninterchangeably. In this order of ideas action exercises the rigorous function\nand task of a sacrifical and purifying ritual. The external vicissitudes\nexperienced during a military campaign cause the inner "enemy" to emerge and\nput up a fierce resistance and agood fight in the form of the animalistic\ninstincts of self-preservation, fear, inertia, compassion, or other passions;\nthose who engage in battles must overcome these feelings by the time they\nenter the battlefield if they wish to win and to defeat the outer enemy or\n"infidel".\\n\\nObviously the spiritual orientation and the "right intention"\n(niya), that is, the one toward transcendence (the symbols employed to refer\nto transcendence are "heaven", "paradise", "Allah\\\'s garden" and so on), are\nsupposed as the foundations of jihad, lest war lose its scared character and\ndegenerate into a wild affair in which true heroism is replaced with reckless\nabandonment and what counts are the unleashed impulses of the animal\nnature.\\n\\nIt is written in the Koran: "Let those who would exchange the life\nof this world for the hereafter fight for the cause of Allah; whether they die\nor conquer, We shall richly reward them." (Koran, 4:76) The presupposition\naccording to which it is prescribed "When you meet the unbelievers in the\nbattlefield strike off their heads, and when you have laid them low, bind your\ncaptives firmly" (Koran 47:4); or, "Do not falter or sue for peace when you\nhave gained the upper hand" (Koran 47:37), is that "the life of this world is\nbut a sport and a past-time" (Koran 47:37) and that "whoever is ungenerous to\nthis cause is ungenerous to himself" (Koran 47:38). These statements should be\ninterpreted along the lines of the evangelical saying: "Whoever wishes to save\nhis life shall lose it: but whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it"\n(Matthew 16:25). This is confirmed by yet another Koranic passage: "Why is it\nthat when it is said to you: \\\'March in the cause of Allah.\\\' you linger\nslothfully in the land? Are you content with this life in preference to the\nlife to come?" (Koran, 9:38) "Say: \\\'Are you waiting for anything to befall us\nexcept victory or martyrdom?\\\'" (Koran, 9:52).\\n\\nAnother passage is relevant\nas well: "Fighting is obligatory for you, as much as you dislike it. But you\nmay hate a thing although it is good for you, and love a thing although it is\nbad for you. Allah knows but you do not." (Koran, 2:216). This passage should\nalso be connected with the following one:\\n\\n"They were content to be with\nthose that stayed behind: a seal was set upon their hearts, leaving them\nbereft of understanding. But the Apostle and the men who shared his faith\nfought with their goods and their persons. These shall be rewarded with good\nthings. They shall surely prosper. Allah has prepared them gardens watered by\nrunning streams, in which they shall abide forever. That is the supreme\ntriumph." (Koran, 9:88 - 9:89)\\n\\nThis place of "rest" (paradise) symbolizes\nthe superindividual states of being, the realization of which is not confined\nto the post-mortem alone,as the following passage indicates: "As for those who\nare slain in the cause of Allah, He will not allow their works to perish. he\nwill vouchsafe them guidance and ennoble their state; He will admit them to\nthe paradise He has made known to them." Koran (47:5-7). In the instance of\nreal death in battle, we find the equivalent of the mors triumphalis found in\nclassical traditions. Those who have experienced the "greater holy war" during\nthe "lesser holy war", have awakened a power that most likely will help them\novercome the crisis of death; this power, having already liberated them from\nthe "enemy" and from the "infidel", will help them avoid the fate of Hades.\nThis is why in classical antiquity the hope of the deceased and the piety of\nhis relatives often caused figures of heroes and of victors to be inscribed on\nthe tombstones. It is possible, however, to go through death and conquer, as\nwell as achieve, the superlife and to ascend to the "heavenly realm" while\nstill alive.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/jihad.html\\n\\nON\nTHE ISLAMIC TRADITION\\nJulius Evola, Revolt Against The Modern World\\n\\nIslam,\nwhich originated among the Semitic races also consisted of the Law and\nTradition, regarded as a formative force, to which the Arab stocks of the\norigins provided a purer and nobler human material that was shaped by a\nwarrior spirit. The Islamic law (shariah) is a divine law; its foundation, the\nKoran, is thought of as God\\\'s very own word (kalam Allah) as well as a\nnonhuman work and an "uncreated book" that exists in heaven ab eterno.\nAlthough Islam considers itself the "religion of Abraham" it is nevertheless\ntrue that (a) it claimed independence from both Judaism and Christianity; (b)\nthe Kaaba, with its symbolism of the center, is a pre-Islamic location and has\neven older origins that cannot be dated accurately; (c) in the esoteric Islam\ntradition, the main reference point is al-Khadir, a popular figure conceived\nas superior to an pre-dating the biblical prophets (Koran 18:59-81). In early\nIslam the only form of asceticism was action, that is, jihad, or "holy war";\nthis type of war, at least theoretically, should never be interrupted until\nthe full consolidation of the divine Law has been achieved. Finally, Islam\npresents a traditional completeness, since the shariah and the sunna, that is,\nthe exoteric law and tradition, have their complement not in vague mysticism,\nbut in full-fledged initiatory organizations (turuq) that are categorized by\nan esoteric teaching (tawil) and by the metaphysical doctrine of the Supreme\nIdentity (tawhid). In these organizations, and in general in the shia, the\nrecurrent notions of the masum, of the double perogative of the isma\n(doctrinal infallibility), and of the impossibility of being stained by any\nsin (which is the perogative of the leaders, the visible and invisible Imams\nand the mujtahid), lead back to the line of an unbroken race shaped by a\ntradition at a higher level than both Judaism and the religious beliefs that\nconquered the West.\\n\\nJulius Evola\\nOn Islam and Tradition, (Revolt Agains\nThe Modern World, pages 243 - 244)\\n\\nEven though it began relatively\nrecently, I will briefly refer to another tradition, Islam, which originated\namong the Semitic races and succeeded in overcoming those negative motifs. As\nin the case of priestly Judaism, the center in Islam also consisted on the Law\nand Tradition, regarded as a formative force, to which the Arab stocks of the\norigins provided a purer and nobler human material that was shaped by a\nwarrior spirit. The Islamic law (shariah) is a divine law; its foundation, the\nKoran, is thought of as God\\\'s very own word (kalam Allah) as well as a\nnonhuman work and an "uncreated book" that exists in heaven ab eterno.\nAlthough Islam considers itself the "religion of Abraham", even to the point\nof attributing to him the foundation of the Kaaba (in which we find again the\ntheme of the "stone", or the symbol of the "center"), it is nevertheless true\nthat (a) it claimed independence from both Judaism and Christianity; (b) the\nKaaba, with its symbolism of the center, is a pre-Islamic location and has\neven older origins that cannot be dated accurately; (c) in the esoteric Islam\ntradition, the main reference point is al-Khadir, a popular figure conceived\nas superior to an pre-dating the biblical prophets (Koran 18:59-81). Islam\nrejects a theme found in Judaism and that in Christianity became the dogma and\nthe basis fof the mystery of the incantation of the Logos; it retains,\nsensibly attenuated, the myth of Adam\\\'s fall without building upon it the\ntheme of "original sin". In this doctrine Islam saw a "diabolical illusion"\n(talbis Iblis) or the inverted theme of the fall of Satan (Iblis or Shaitan),\nwhich the Koran (18:48) attributed to his refusal, together with all his\nangels, to bow down before Adam. Islam also not only rejected the idea of a\nRedeemer or Savior, which is so central in Christianity, but also the\nmediation of a priestly caste. By conceiving the Divine in terms of an\nabsolute and pure monotheism, without a "Son", a "Father", or a "Mother of\nGod", every person as a Muslim appears to respond directly to God and to be\nsanctified through the Law, which permeates and organizes life in a radical\nunitary way in all of its juridicial, religious, and social ramifications. In\nearly Islam the only form of asceticism was action, that is, jihad, or "holy\nwar"; this type of war, at least theoretically, should never be interrupted\nuntil the full consolidation of the divine Law has been achieved. it is\nprecisely through the holy war, and not through preaching or missionary\nendeavor, that Islam came to enjoy a sudden, prodigious expansion, originating\nthe empire of the Caliphs as well as forging a unity typical of a race of the\nspirit, namely, the umma or "Islamic nation". Finally, Islam presents a\ntraditional completeness, since the shariah and the sunna, that is, the\nexoteric law and tradition, have their complement not in vague mysticism, but\nin full-fledged initiatory organizations (turuq) that are categorized by an\nesoteric teaching (tawil) and by the metaphysical doctrine of the Supreme\nIdentity (tawhid). In these organizations, and in general in the shia, the\nrecurrent notions of the masum, of the double perogative of the isma\n(doctrinal infallibility), and of the impossibility of being stained by any\nsin (which is the perogative of the leaders, the visible and invisible Imams\nand the mujtahid), lead back to the line of an unbroken race shaped by a\ntradition at a higher level than both Judaism and the religious beliefs that\nconquered the West.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/islam.html\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfThe occult war\\n\\nExcerpt from "Men Among the Ruins" by Julius\nEvola\\n\\nVarious causes have been adduced to explain the crisis that has\naffected and still affects the life of modern peoples: historical, social,\nsocioeconomic, political, moral, and cultural causes, according to different\nperspectives. The part played by each of these causes should not be denied.\nHowever, we need to ask a higher and essential question: are these always the\nfirst causes and do they have an inevitable character like those causes found\nin the material world? Do they supply an ultimate explanation or, in some\ncases, is it necessary to identify influences of a higher order, which may\ncause what has occurred in the West to appear very suspicious, and which,\nbeyond the multiplicity of individual aspects, suggest that there is the same\nlogic at work?\\n\\nThe concept of occult war must be defined within the context\nof the dilemma. The occult war is a battle that is waged imperceptibly by the\nforces of global subversion, with means and in circumstances ignored by\ncurrent historiography. The notion of occult war belongs to a three-\ndimensional view of history: this view does not regard as essential the two\nsuperficial dimensions of time and space (which include causes, facts, and\nvisible leaders) but rather emphasizes the dimension of depth, or the\n"subterranean" dimension in which forces and influences often act in a\ndecisive manner, and which, more often not than not, cannot be reduced to what\nis merely human, whether at an individual or a collective level.\\n\\nHaving\nsaid that, it is necessary to specify the meaning of the term "subterranean."\nWe should not think, in this regard, of a dark and irrational background which\nstands in relation to the known forces of history as the unconscious stands to\nconsciousness, in the way the latter relationship is discussed in the recently\ndeveloped "Depth Psychology." If anything, we can talk about the unconscious\nonly in regard to those who, according to the three-dimensional view, appear\nto be history\\\'s objects rather than its subjects, since in their thoughts and\nconduct they are scarcely aware of the influences which they obey and the\ngoals that they contribute toward achieving. In these people, the center falls\nmore in the unconscious and the pre-conscious than in the clear reflected\nconsciousness, no matter what they-who are often men of action and ideologues-\nbelieve. Considering this relation, we can say that the most decisive actions\nof the occult war take place in the human unconscious. However, if we consider\nthe true agents of history in the special aspects we are now discussing,\nthings are otherwise: here we cannot talk of the subconscious or the\nunconscious, since we are dealing with intelligent forces that know very well\nwhat they want and what are the means most suited to achieve their\nobjectives.\\n\\nThe third dimension of history should not be diluted in the fog\nof abstract philosophical or sociological concepts, but should rather be\nthought of as a "backstage" dimension where specific "intelligences" are at\nwork.\\n\\nAn investigation of the secret history that aspires to be positivist\nand scientific should not be too lofty or removed from reality. However, it is\nnecessary to assume as the ultimate reference point a dualistic scheme not\ndissimilar from the one found in an older tradition. Catholic historiography\nused to regard history not only as a mechanism of natural, political,\neconomic, and social causes, but also as the unfolding of divine Providence,\nto which hostile forces are opposed. These forces are sometimes referred to in\na moralistic fashion as "forces of evil," or in a theological fashion as the\n"forces of the Anti-Christ." Such a view has a positive content, provided it\nis purified and emphasized by bringing it to a less religious and more\nmetaphysical plane, as was done in Classical and Indo-European antiquity:\nforces of the cosmos against forces of chaos. To the former correspond\neverything that is form, order, law, spiritual hierarchy, and tradition in the\nhigher sense of the word; to the latter correspond every influence that\ndisintegrates, subverts, degrades, and promotes the predominance of the\ninferior over the superior, matter over spirit, quantity over quality. This is\nwhat can be said in regard to the ultimate reference points of the various\ninfluences that act upon the realm of tangible causes, behind known history.\nThese must be taken into account, though with some prudence. Let me repeat:\naside from this necessary metaphysical background, let us never lose sight of\nconcrete history.\\n\\nMethodologically speaking, we need to be careful to\nprevent valid insights from degenerating into fantasies and superstition, and\nnot develop the tendency to see an occult background everywhere and at all\ncosts. In this regard, every assumption we make must have the character of\nwhat are called "working hypotheses" in scientific research: as when something\nis admitted provisionally, thus allowing the gathering and arranging of a\ngroup of apparently isolated facts, only to confer on them a character not of\nhypothesis but of truth when, at the end of a serious inductive work, the data\nconverge in validating the original assumption. Every time an effect outlasts\nand transcends its tangible causes, a suspicion should arise, and a positive\nor negative influence behind the stages should be perceived. A problem is\nposited, but in analyzing it and seeking its solution, prudence must be\nexercised. The fact that those who have ventured in this direction have not\nrestrained their wild imaginations has discredited what could have been a\nscience, the results of which could hardly be overestimated. This too meets\nthe expectations of the hidden enemy.\\n\\nAfter considering the state of\nsociety and modern civilization, one should ask if this is not a specific case\nthat requires the application of this method; in other words, one should ask\nwhether some situations of real crisis and radical subversion in the modern\nworld can be satisfactorily explained through "natural" and spontaneous\nprocesses, or whether we need to refer to something that has been concerted,\nnamely a still unfolding plan, devised by forces hiding in the\nshadows.\\n\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/occult.html\\n\\n\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfThe Meaning and Context of Zen\\nby Baron Julius Evola\\n\\n \\n\\nWe\nknow the kind of interest Zen has evoked even outside specialized disciplines,\nsince being popularized in the west by D.T. Suzuki through his books\nIntroduction to Zen Buddhism and Essays in Zen Buddhism. This popular interest\nis due to the paradoxical encounter between East and West. The ailing West\nperceives that Zen has something "existential" and surrealistic to offer.\nZen\\\'s notion of a spiritual realization, free from any faith and any bond,\nnot to mention the mirage of an instantaneous and somehow gratuitous\n"spiritual breakthrough", has exercised a fascinating attraction on many\nWesterners. However, this is true, for the most part, only superficially.\nThere is a considerable difference between the spiritual dimension of the\n"philosophy of crisis", which has become popular in the West as a consequence\nof its materialistic and nihilist development, and the spiritual dimension of\nZen, which has been rooted in the spirituality of the Buddhist tradition. Any\ntrue encounter between Zen and the West, presupposes, in a Westerner, either\nan exceptional predisposition, or the capability to operate a metanoia. By\nmetanoia I mean an inner turnabout, affecting not so much one\\\'s intellectual\n"attitudes", but rather a dimension which in every time and in every place has\nbeen conceived as a deeper reality.\\n\\n \\n\\nZen has a secret doctrine and not\nto be found in scriptures. It was passed on by the Buddha to his disciple\nMahakassapa. This secret doctrine was introduced in China around the sixth\ncentury C.E. by Bodhidharma. The canon was transmitted in China and Japan\nthrough a succession on teachers and "patriarchs". In Japan it is a living\ntradition and has many advocates and numerous Zendos ("Halls of\nMeditation").\\n\\n \\n\\nAs far as the spirit informing the tradition is\nconcerned, Zen may be considered as a continuation of early Buddhism. Buddhism\narose as a vigorous reaction against the theological speculation and the\nshallow ritualism into which the ancient Hindu priestly caste had degraded\nafter possessing a sacred, lively wisdom since ancient times. Buddha mad\ntabula rassa of all this: he focused instead on the practical problem of how\nto overcome what in the popular mind is referred to as "life\\\'s suffering".\nAccording to esoteric teachings, this suffering was considered as the state of\ncaducity, restlessness, "thirst" and the forgetfulness typical of ordinary\npeople. Having followed the path leading to spiritual awakening and to\nimmortality without external aid, Buddha pointed the way to those who felt an\nattraction to it. It is well known that Buddha is not a name, but an attribute\nor a title meaning "the awakened One", "He who has achieved enlightenment", or\n"the awakening". Buddha was silent about the content of his experience, since\nhe wanted to discourage people from assigning to speculation and\nphilosophizing a primacy over action. Therefore, unlike his predecessors, he\ndid not talk about Brahman (the absolute), or about Atman (the transcendental\nSelf), but only employees the term nirvana, at the risk of being\nmisunderstood. Some, in fact, thought, in their lack of understanding, that\nnirvana was to be identified with the notion of "nothingness", an ineffable\nand evanescent transcendence, almost bordering on the limits of the\nunconscious and of a state of unaware non-being. So, in a further development\nof Buddhism, what occurred again, mutatis mutandi, was exactly the situation\nagainst which Buddha had reacted; Buddhism became a religion, complete with\ndogmas, rituals, scholasticism and mythology. It eventually became\ndifferentiated into two schools: Mahayana and Hinayana. The former was more\ngrandiose in metaphysics an Mahayana eventually grew complacent with its\nabstruse symbolism. The teachings of the latter school were more strict and to\nthe point, and yet too concerned about the mere moral discipline which became\nincreasingly monastic. Thus the essential and original nucleus, namely the\nesoteric doctrine of the enlightenment, was almost lost.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt this\ncrucial time Zen appeared, declaring the uselessness of these so-called\nmethods and proclaiming the doctrine of satori. Satori is a fundamental inner\nevent, a sudden existential breakthrough, corresponding in essence to what I\nhave called the "awakening". But this formulation was new and original and it\nconstituted a radical change in approach. Nirvana, which had been variously\nconsidered as the alleged Nothingness, as extinction, and as the final end\nresult of an effort aimed at obtaining liberation (which according to some may\nrequire more than one lifetime), now came to be considered as the normal human\ncondition. By these lights, every person has the nature of Buddha and every\nperson is already liberated, and therefore, situated above and beyond birth\nand death. It is only necessary to become aware of it, to realize it, to see\nwithin one\\\'s nature, according to Zen\\\'s main expression. Satori is like a\ntimeless opening up. On the one hand, satori is something sudden and radically\ndifferent from all the ordinary human states of consciousness; it is like a\ncatastrophic trauma within ordinary consciousness. On the other hand, satori\nis what leads one back to what, in a higher sense, should be considered as\nnormal and natural; thus, it is the exact opposite of an ecstasis, or trance.\nIt is the rediscovery and the appropriation of one\\\'s true nature: it is the\nenlightenment which draws out of ignorance or out of the subconscious the deep\nreality of what was and will always be, regardless of one\\\'s condition in\nlife. The consequence of satori is a completely new way to look at the world\nand at life. To those who have experienced it, everything is the same (things,\nother beings, one\\\'s self, "heaven, the rivers and the vast earth"), and yet\neverything is fundamentally different. It is as if a new dimension was added\nto reality, transforming the meaning and value. According to the Zen Masters,\nthe essential characteristic of the new experience is the overcoming of very\ndualism: of the inner and outer; the I and not I; of finitude and infinity;\nbeing and not-being; appearance and reality; "empty" and "full"; substance and\naccidents. Another characteristic is that any value posed by the finite and\nconfused consciousness of the individual, is no longer discernible. And thus,\nthe liberated and the non-liberated, the enlightened and the non-enlightened,\nare yet one and same thing. Zen effectively perpetuates the paradoxical\nequation of Mahayana Buddhism, nirvana-samsara, and the Taoist saying "the\nreturn is infinitely far". It is as if Zen said: liberation should not be\nlooked for in the next world; the very world is the next world; it is\nliberation and it does not need to be liberated. This is the point of view of\nsatori, of perfect enlightenment, of "transcendent wisdom"\n(prajnaparamita)\\n\\n \\n\\nBasically, this consciousness is a shift of the\nself\\\'s center. In any situation and in any event of ordinary life, including\nthe most trivial ones, the ordinary, dualistic and intellectual sense of\none\\\'s self is substituted with a being who no longer perceives an "I" opposed\nto a "non-I", and who transcends and overcomes any antithesis. This being\neventually comes to enjoy a perfect freedom an incoercibility. He is like the\nwind, which blows where it wills, and like a naked being which is everything\nafter "letting go" -abandons everything, embracing poverty.\\n\\nZen, or at\nleast mainstream Zen, emphasizes the discontinuous, sudden and unpredictable\ncharacter of satori disclosure. In regard to this, Suzuki was at fault when he\ntook issue with the techniques used in Hindu schools such as Samkya and Yoga.\nThese techniques were also contemplated in early Buddhist texts. Suzuki\nemployed the simile of water, which in a moment turns into ice. He also used\nthe simile of an alarm, which, as a consequence of some vibration, suddenly\ngoes off. There are no disciplines, techniques or efforts, according to\nSuzuki, which by themselves may lead one to satori. On the contrary, it is\nclaimed that satori often occurs spontaneously, when one has exhausted all the\nresources of his being, especially the intellect and logical faculty of\nunderstanding. In some cases satori it is said to be facilitated by violent\nsensations and even by physical pain. Its cause may be the mere perception of\nan object as well as any event in ordinary life, provided a certain latent\npredisposition exists in the subject.\\n\\n \\n\\nRegarding this, some\nmisunderstandings may occur. Suzuki acknowledged that "generally speaking,\nthere are no indications on the inner work preceding satori". However, he\ntalked about the necessity of first going through "a true baptism of fire".\nAfter all, the very institution of the so-called "Halls of Meditation"\n(Zendo), where those who strive to obtain a satori submit themselves to a\nregimen of life which is partially analogous to that of some Catholic\nreligious orders, bespeaks the necessity of a preliminary preparation. This\npreparation may last for several years. The essence of Zen seems to consist in\na maturation process, identical to the one in which one almost reaches a state\nof an acute existential instability. At that point, the slightest push is\nsufficient to produce a change of state, a spiritual breakthrough, the opening\nwhich leads to the "intuitive vision of one\\\'s nature". The Masters know the\nmoment in which the mind of the disciple is mature and ready to open up; it is\nten that they eventually give the final. Decisive push. This push may\nsometimes consist of a simple gesture, an exclamation, in something apparently\nirrelevant, or even illogical and absurd. This suffices to induce the collapse\nof the false notion of individuality. Thus, satori replaces this notion with\nthe "normal state", and one assumes the "original face, which one had before\ncreation". One no longer "chases after echoes" and "shadows". This under some\naspects brings to mind the existential theme of "failure", or of "being\nshipwrecked" (das Scheitern, in Kierkegaard and in Jaspers). In fact, as I\nhave mentioned, the opening often takes place when all the resources of one\\\'s\nbeing have been exhausted and one has his back against the wall. This can be\nseen in relation to some practical teachings methods used by Zen. The most\nfrequently employed methods, on an intellectual plane, are the koan and the\nmondo. The disciple is confronted with a saying or with questions which are\nparadoxical, absurd and sometimes even grotesque and "surrealistic". He must\nlabor with his mind, if necessary for years, until he has reached the extreme\nlimit of all his normal faculties of comprehension. Then, if he dares proceed\nfurther on that road he may find catastrophe, but if he can turn the situation\nupside down, he may achieve metanoia. This is the point where satori is\nusually achieved.\\n\\n \\n\\nZen\\\'s norm is that of absolute autonomy; no gods,\nno cults, no idols. To literally empty oneself of everything, including God.\n"If you meet Buddha on the road, kill him", a saying goes. It is necessary to\nabandon everything, without leaning on anything, and then to proceed forward,\nwith one\\\'s essence, until the crisis point is reached. It is very difficult\nto say more about satori, or to compare it with various forms of initiatory\nmystical experience whether Eastern or Western. One is supposed to spend only\nthe training period in Zen monasteries. Once the disciple has achieved satori,\nhe return to the world, choosing a way of life that fits his need. One may\nthink of satori as a form of transcendence which is brought to immanence, as a\nnatural state, in every form of life.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe behavior which proceeds from\nthe newly acquired dimension, which is added to reality as a consequence of\nsatori, may well be summarized by Lao Tzu\\\'s expression: "To be the whole in\nthe part". In regard to this, it is important to realize the influence which\nZen has exercised on the Far-Eastern way of life. Zen has been called "the\nsamurai\\\'s philosophy," and it had also been said that "the way of Zen is\nidentical to the way of archery," or to the "way of the sword". This means\nthat any activity in one\\\'s life, may be permeated by Zen and thus be elevated\nto a higher meaning, to a "wholesomeness" and to an "impersonal activity".\nThis kind of activity is based on a sense of the individual\\\'s irrelevance,\nwhich nevertheless does not paralyze one\\\'s actions, but which rather confers\ncam and detachment. This detachment, in turn, favors an absolute and "pure"\nundertaking of life, which in some cases reaches extreme and distinct forms of\nself-sacrifice and heroism, inconceivable to the majority of Westerners (e.g.\nthe kamikaze in WWII).\\n\\n \\n\\nThus, what C.G. Jung claims is simply\nridiculous, namely that Psychoanalysis, more than any other Western school of\nthought, is capable of understanding Zen. According to Jung, satori coincides\nwith the state of wholeness, devoid of complexes or inner splitting, which\npsychoanalytic treatment claims to achieve whenever the intellect\\\'s\nobstructions and its sense of superiority are removed, and whenever the\nconscious dimension of the soul is reunited with the unconscious and with\n"Life". Jung did not realize that the methods and presuppositions of Zen, are\nexactly the opposite of his own. There is no "subconscious", as a distinct\nentity, to which the conscious has to be reconnected; Zen speaks of a\nsuperconscious vision (enlightenment, bodhi or "awakening"), which actualizes\nthe "original and luminous nature" and which, in so doing, destroys the\nunconscious. It is possible though, to notice similarities between Jung\\\'s\nview\\\'s and Zen\\\', since they both talk about the feeling of one\\\'s "totality"\nand freedom which is manifested in every aspect of life. However, it is\nimportant to explain the level at which these views appear to coincide.\\n\\n\n\\n\\nOnce Zen found its way to the West, there was a tendency to "domesticate"\nand to moralize it, playing down its potential radical and "antinomian"\n(namely, antithetical to current norms) implications, and by emphasizing the\nstandard ingredients which are held so dear by "spiritual" people, namely love\nand service to one\\\'s neighbor, even though these ingredients have been\npurified in an impersonal and non-sentimental form. Generally speaking, there\nare many doubts on the "practicability" o f Zen, considering that the\n"doctrine of the awakening" has an initiatory character.\\n\\n \\n\\nThus, it will\nonly be able to inspire a minority of people, in contrast to later Buddhist\nviews, which took the form of a religion open to everyone, for the most part a\ncode of mere morality. As the re-establishment of the spirit of early\nBuddhism, Zen should have strictly been an esoteric doctrine. It has been so\nas we can see by examining the legend concerning its origins. However, Suzuki\nhimself was inclined to give a different account; he emphasized those aspects\nof Mahayana which "democratize" Buddhism (after all, the term Mahayana has\nbeen interpreted to mean "Great Vehicle", even in the sense that it extends to\nwider audiences, and not just to a few elect). If one was to fully agree with\nSuzuki, some perplexities on the nature and on the scope of satori may arise.\nOne should ask whether such an experience merely affects the psychological,\nmoral or mental domain, or whether it affects the ontological domain, as is\nthe case in every authentic initiation. In that event, it can only be the\nprivilege a very restricted number of\npeople.\\n\\nhttp://pages.zoom.co.uk/thuban/html/zen.htm\'\n\n'b'b\'\\xef\\xbb\\xbf\\n\\nThe Plurality and Duality of Civilizations\\n\\nRecently, in\ncontrast to the notion of progress and the idea that history has been\nrepresented as the more or less continuous upward evolution of collective\nhumanity, the idea of a plurality of the forms of civilization and of a\nrelative incommunicability between them has been confirmed.\\nAccording to this\nsecond and new version of history, civilization breaks down into epochs and\ndisconnected cycles. At a given moment and within a given race a specific\nconception of the world and of life is affirmed from which follows a specific\nsystem of truths, principles, understandings, and realizations. A civilization\nsprings up, gradually reaches a culminating point, and then falls into\ndarkness and, more often than not, disappears.\\nA cycle has ended. Perhaps\nanother will rise again some day, somewhere else. Perhaps it may even take up\nthe concerns of preceding civilizations, but any connection between them will\nbe strictly analogical. The transition from one cycle of civilization to\nanother - one completely alien to the other - implies a jump, which in\nmathematics is called a discontinuity. Although this view is a healthy\nreaction to the superstition of history as progress - which came into fashion\nmore or less at the same time as materialism and Western scientism-\nnevertheless, we should be cautious, for in addition to a plurality of\ncivilizations we have to recognize a duality, especially when we limit\nourselves to those times and essential structures that we can embrace with\nsome measure of certainty.\\nModern civilization stands on one side and on the\nother the entirety of all the civilizations that have preceded it (for the\nWest, we can put the dividing line at the end of the Middle Ages). At this\npoint the rupture is complete. Apart from the multitudinous variety of its\nforms, pre-modern civilization, which we may as well call "traditional", means\nsomething quite different. For there are two worlds, one which has separated\nitself by cutting off nearly every contact with the past. For the great\nmajority of moderns, that means any possibility of understanding the\ntraditional world has been completely lost.\\nThis premise is indispensable for\nthe examination of our subject [alchemy]. The hermetico-alchemical tradition\nforms part of the cycle of pre-modern "traditional" civilization and in order\nto understand its spirit we need to translate it inwardly from one world to\nthe other. Who undertakes this study without having acquired the ability to\nrise above the modern mind-set or who has not awakened to a new sensitivity\nthat can place itself in contact with the general spiritual stream that gave\nlife to the tradition in the first place, will succeed only in filling his\nhead with words, symbols, and fantastic allegories. Moreover, it is not just a\nquestion of intellectual understanding. We have to bear in mind that ancient\nman not only had a different way of thinking and feeling, but also a different\nway of perceiving and knowing. The heart of the matter that will concern us is\nto re-evoke, by means of an actual transformation of the consciousness, this\nolder basis of understanding and action.\\nOnly then will the unexpected light\nof certain expression dawn on us and certain symbols be empowered to awaken\nour interior perception. Only then will we be conducted through them to new\nheights of human realization and to the understanding that will make it\npossible for designated "rites" to confer "magical" and operant power, and for\nthe creation of a new "science" that bears no resemblance to anything that\ngoes by that name\ntoday.\\n\\nhttp://feastofhateandfear.com/archives/jevola2.html\\n\\n\'\n\n'
